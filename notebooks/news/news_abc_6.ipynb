      "The full details of the controversial national security law thrust upon Hong Kong by Beijing have been released, and it goes much further than had previously been predicted.Key points:Life sentences are possible for serious anti-state crimesThe law covers many of the activities of Hong Kong's protest movementAustralia is among around two-dozen countries criticising the lawWhile there has been growing concern both in Hong Kong and around the world about the changes, the details of the legislation were only made public after it came into effect at 11:00pm yesterday, hours after Beijing passed it into law by decree.We now know the laws will punish crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.Even asking foreign countries to sanction or take any form of action against Hong Kong or China could be considered as collusion with foreign forces under the law.Hong Kong police said they arrested a man holding a flag advocating for independence, the first arrest under the new laws.Pictures posted by police on Twitter showed the flag lying on the sidewalk in front of a man wearing a black T-shirt with \"Free Hong Kong\" written on it.The law marks a new era for Hong Kong, and critics say it has effectively killed off the former British colony's autonomy from mainland China.Here's what you need to know.What's in the new law? Courts in mainland China will have the power to hear some national security cases from Hong Kong.(AP: Vincent Yu)Early assessments of the law suggest some elements are stronger than many feared, both in scope and penalties.The crimes of secession, subversion of state power, terrorism and colluding with foreign countries and external elements — such as foreign institutions, organisations and personnel — could result in penalties of up to life in prison.Hong Kong protests explainedThe complicated conflict broken down in simple terms to help you get a handle on what's going on Read moreThis has stunned some legal scholars, who say even peaceful actions such as the pro-democracy Occupy protests of 2014 could now bring 10 years' jail if foreign links could be proven.It also provides for more active state management and oversight of foreign groups, organisations and media based in Hong Kong, which has for decades been China's freest and most international city.It demands disqualification for elected politicians who breach the law, a move certain to rile democracy activists in the run-up to crucial elections for Hong Kong's Legislative Council in September. Molotov cocktails were used by some violent protesters. Arson is now listed as a terror offence.(Reuters: Athit Perawongmetha)And while the laws will not be applied retroactively against crimes committed before it was implemented, some of the actions of those who took part in the violent protests that have rocked Hong Kong over the past 12 months may now constitute terror offences.Terror offences:Severe violence against peopleExplosions, arson or the release of pathogens, poisons and other substancesDestruction of vehicles, public transport, power and gas equipment, or other flammable and explosive equipmentSeverely disrupting and destroying electronic control systems for public services like water, power, transportation and communicationsUsing other dangerous methods to seriously endanger public health of safetyDamaging public transport would be considered a terror offence, and damaging government buildings would also be a serious offence.One major concern is that the legislation allows mainland Chinese security and intelligence agents to operate in Hong Kong on an official basis, and gives them powers that go beyond local laws.These agents will be allowed to carry out surveillance of people suspected of endangering national security, including through the use of wiretaps, and cannot be detained or inspected by local authorities while carrying out their duties.The intelligence agents will have a new base in the city at a mainland security commission, while Hong Kong's Government will also have its own commission, backed by a special police unit.Up until now, Hong Kong has boasted a proudly independent judiciary and a separate, common-law-based legal system — but that will also face unprecedented pressure under the new law.The national security law allows Hong Kong's chief executive to appoint judges for national security cases, and lets mainland courts hear serious and complex Hong Kong cases in certain situations. Protesters stormed Hong Kong's legislature last year during the protests: such actions would now fall under the national security law.(AP: Kin Cheung)These include cases allegedly involving collusion with foreign forces, but it's still not known how suspects will be taken to the mainland, given Hong Kong has no formal extradition arrangements with Beijing.There is also a provision allowing for trials to take place secretly, barring public and media access to proceedings, if the case involves \"state secrets or public order\". However judgements must be publicised.Media organisations that publish articles or images about things judged to be terror offences could be prosecuted under a section that bans promoting or inciting terrorist activities.What has the local reaction been? Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's pro-Beijing chief executive, is a supporter of the law.(Reuters: Tyrone Siu)Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam says mainland national security laws are long overdue for the territory.But many in the city are waiting to see if action will be swift or whether authorities will wait to test their new institutions and cautiously build cases.Some high-profile democracy and independence activists have said they expected to become the first to be detained under the new regime, and as a result chose to disband their groups.LoadingWithin two hours of the law being announced, the Government revealed special local police and justice department prosecution units had already been formed to enforce the law.Fear has been building in some political, activist, academic, religious and business circles and some predict that, beyond high-profile cases, the law will chill the openness that they have taken for granted. Some say privately they are questioning whether they should leave Hong Kong.\"The punitive elements of the law are stupefying,\" Simon Young, a law professor at the University of Hong Kong's law school, and a barrister, told Reuters.\"Let us hope no-one tries to test this law, for the consequences to the individual and the legal system will be irreparable.\"What has the international community said? Calling for the international community to take action could now be considered a form of \"collusion\".(AP: Vincent Yu)Australia has joined more than 20 other countries in expressing deep concern about the new national security law for Hong Kong.Foreign Minister Marise Payne said the Federal Government was troubled that the laws were passed without any input from the people of Hong Kong, or the city's legislature and judiciary.Senator Payne said the eyes of the world were on Hong Kong, and that the legislation undermined the \"one country, two systems\" model adopted when the UK handed back control of the city to Beijing.Hong Kong's countdown to 2047Hong Kong was handed back to China with no framework for what would happen after the year 2047, leaving the city to carve an identity out of two ideologically opposed empires.Read moreUK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said it violated the agreement between Britain and Hong Kong, which was finalised on this day in 1997.Hong Kong's former colonial power joined the European Union, Japan and the US in condemning the law, and calling on Beijing to preserve the right to assembly and free press.\"The United States will not stand idly by while China swallows Hong Kong into its authoritarian maw,\" US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement.He said the United States would stand with the people of Hong Kong and \"respond to Beijing's attacks on freedoms of speech, the press, and assembly, as well as the rule of law\".Washington began eliminating Hong Kong's special status under US law this week, halting defence exports and restricting technology access.What has Beijing had to say? China denies that the law goes against the agreement it struck with Britain in 1997.(AP: Kin Cheung)China has rejected criticism of the law and says it will retaliate against the US over its punitive actions.Asked about criticism that the law undermined the \"one country, two systems\" model, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian hit out against what he said was \"foreign interference\" in China's business.China's explosive new national security lawFor two decades, Beijing has been frustrated by opposition to security laws in Hong Kong. But Xi Jinping is now convinced winning local support is futile, writes Bill Birtles.Read more\"Hong Kong affairs are entirely China's internal affairs that allow no foreign interference,\" he said.\"Establishing and improving a legal framework and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security in Hong Kong is in itself an embodiment of one country, two systems.\"It is to ensure the steady implementation of this principle as well as the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, which has been endorsed by all Chinese people, including our compatriots in Hong Kong, and most countries in the world.\"Both Hong Kong and Chinese central government officials have said the law is vital to plug gaping holes in Hong Kong's national security defences — deficiencies exposed in the months of sometimes-violent protests that rocked the city in the past year.Hong Kong and Chinese officials have repeatedly said only a tiny number of people will be targeted by the new laws and that the rights and freedoms of ordinary people will not be affected.ABC/WiresPosted  1 JulJuly 2020WedWednesday 1 JulJuly 2020 at 5:16am, updated 1 JulJuly 2020WedWednesday 1 JulJuly 2020 at 4:06pmShareCopy linkFacebookTwitterArticle share optionsShare this onFacebookTwitterLinkedInSend this byEmailMessengerCopy linkWhatsAppRelated StoriesThe handover was a historic moment, but some Hongkongers in Australia say it sold out their futureChina reveals new national security law for Hong Kong to stop 'terrorism' amid international condemnationHere's what you need to know about the controversial laws Beijing is passing on Hong KongMore on:Hong KongChinaAsiaWorld PoliticsPolitics and GovernmentTerrorismDemonstrationLaw, Crime and JusticeForeign AffairsActivism and Lobbying\n"

Chinese security and intelligence agents to operate in Hong Kong on an official basis, and gives them powers that go beyond local laws.</p><p class=\"_1HzXw\">These agents will be allowed to carry out surveillance of people suspected of endangering national security, including through the use of wiretaps, and cannot be detained or inspected by local authorities while carrying out their duties.</p><p class=\"_1HzXw\">The intelligence agents will have a new base in the city at a mainland security commission, while Hong Kong's Government will also have its own commission, backed by a

pressure under the new law.</p><p class=\"_1HzXw\">The national security law allows Hong Kong's chief executive to appoint judges for national security cases, and lets mainland courts hear serious and

       "'The full details of the controversial national security law thrust upon Hong Kong by Beijing have been released, and it goes much further than had previously been predicted.Key points:Life sentences are possible for serious anti-state crimesThe law covers many of the activities of Hong Kong\\'s protest movementAustralia is among around two-dozen countries criticising the lawWhile there has been growing concern both in Hong Kong and around the world about the changes, the details of the legislation were only made public after it came into effect at 11:00pm yesterday, hours after Beijing passed it into law by decree.We now know the laws will punish crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.Even asking foreign countries to sanction or take any form of action against Hong Kong or China could be considered as collusion with foreign forces under the law.Hong Kong police said they arrested a man holding a flag advocating for independence, the first arrest under the new laws.Pictures posted by police on Twitter showed the flag lying on the sidewalk in front of a man wearing a black T-shirt with \"Free Hong Kong\" written on it.The law marks a new era for Hong Kong, and critics say it has effectively killed off the former British colony\\'s autonomy from mainland China.Here\\'s what you need to know.What\\'s in the new law? Courts in mainland China will have the power to hear some national security cases from Hong Kong.(AP: Vincent Yu)Early assessments of the law suggest some elements are stronger than many feared, both in scope and penalties.The crimes of secession, subversion of state power, terrorism and colluding with foreign countries and external elements — such as foreign institutions, organisations and personnel — could result in penalties of up to life in prison.Hong Kong protests explainedThe complicated conflict broken down in simple terms to help you get a handle on what\\'s going on Read moreThis has stunned some legal scholars, who say even peaceful actions such as the pro-democracy Occupy protests of 2014 could now bring 10 years\\' jail if foreign links could be proven.It also provides for more active state management and oversight of foreign groups, organisations and media based in Hong Kong, which has for decades been China\\'s freest and most international city.It demands disqualification for elected politicians who breach the law, a move certain to rile democracy activists in the run-up to crucial elections for Hong Kong\\'s Legislative Council in September. Molotov cocktails were used by some violent protesters. Arson is now listed as a terror offence.(Reuters: Athit Perawongmetha)And while the laws will not be applied retroactively against crimes committed before it was implemented, some of the actions of those who took part in the violent protests that have rocked Hong Kong over the past 12 months may now constitute terror offences.Terror offences:Severe violence against peopleExplosions, arson or the release of pathogens, poisons and other substancesDestruction of vehicles, public transport, power and gas equipment, or other flammable and explosive equipmentSeverely disrupting and destroying electronic control systems for public services like water, power, transportation and communicationsUsing other dangerous methods to seriously endanger public health of safetyDamaging public transport would be considered a terror offence, and damaging government buildings would also be a serious offence.One major concern is that the legislation allows mainland Chinese security and intelligence agents to operate in Hong Kong on an official basis, and gives them powers that go beyond local laws.These agents will be allowed to carry out surveillance of people suspected of endangering national security, including through the use of wiretaps, and cannot be detained or inspected by local authorities while carrying out their duties.The intelligence agents will have a new base in the city at a mainland security commission, while Hong Kong\\'s Government will also have its own commission, backed by a special police unit.Up until now, Hong Kong has boasted a proudly independent judiciary and a separate, common-law-based legal system — but that will also face unprecedented pressure under the new law.The national security law allows Hong Kong\\'s chief executive to appoint judges for national security cases, and lets mainland courts hear serious and complex Hong Kong cases in certain situations. Protesters stormed Hong Kong\\'s legislature last year during the protests: such actions would now fall under the national security law.(AP: Kin Cheung)These include cases allegedly involving collusion with foreign forces, but it\\'s still not known how suspects will be taken to the mainland, given Hong Kong has no formal extradition arrangements with Beijing.There is also a provision allowing for trials to take place secretly, barring public and media access to proceedings, if the case involves \"state secrets or public order\". However judgements must be publicised.Media organisations that publish articles or images about things judged to be terror offences could be prosecuted under a section that bans promoting or inciting terrorist activities.What has the local reaction been? Carrie Lam, Hong Kong\\'s pro-Beijing chief executive, is a supporter of the law.(Reuters: Tyrone Siu)Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam says mainland national security laws are long overdue for the territory.But many in the city are waiting to see if action will be swift or whether authorities will wait to test their new institutions and cautiously build cases.Some high-profile democracy and independence activists have said they expected to become the first to be detained under the new regime, and as a result chose to disband their groups.LoadingWithin two hours of the law being announced, the Government revealed special local police and justice department prosecution units had already been formed to enforce the law.Fear has been building in some political, activist, academic, religious and business circles and some predict that, beyond high-profile cases, the law will chill the openness that they have taken for granted. Some say privately they are questioning whether they should leave Hong Kong.\"The punitive elements of the law are stupefying,\" Simon Young, a law professor at the University of Hong Kong\\'s law school, and a barrister, told Reuters.\"Let us hope no-one tries to test this law, for the consequences to the individual and the legal system will be irreparable.\"What has the international community said? Calling for the international community to take action could now be considered a form of \"collusion\".(AP: Vincent Yu)Australia has joined more than 20 other countries in expressing deep concern about the new national security law for Hong Kong.Foreign Minister Marise Payne said the Federal Government was troubled that the laws were passed without any input from the people of Hong Kong, or the city\\'s legislature and judiciary.Senator Payne said the eyes of the world were on Hong Kong, and that the legislation undermined the \"one country, two systems\" model adopted when the UK handed back control of the city to Beijing.Hong Kong\\'s countdown to 2047Hong Kong was handed back to China with no framework for what would happen after the year 2047, leaving the city to carve an identity out of two ideologically opposed empires.Read moreUK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said it violated the agreement between Britain and Hong Kong, which was finalised on this day in 1997.Hong Kong\\'s former colonial power joined the European Union, Japan and the US in condemning the law, and calling on Beijing to preserve the right to assembly and free press.\"The United States will not stand idly by while China swallows Hong Kong into its authoritarian maw,\" US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement.He said the United States would stand with the people of Hong Kong and \"respond to Beijing\\'s attacks on freedoms of speech, the press, and assembly, as well as the rule of law\".Washington began eliminating Hong Kong\\'s special status under US law this week, halting defence exports and restricting technology access.What has Beijing had to say? China denies that the law goes against the agreement it struck with Britain in 1997.(AP: Kin Cheung)China has rejected criticism of the law and says it will retaliate against the US over its punitive actions.Asked about criticism that the law undermined the \"one country, two systems\" model, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian hit out against what he said was \"foreign interference\" in China\\'s business.China\\'s explosive new national security lawFor two decades, Beijing has been frustrated by opposition to security laws in Hong Kong. But Xi Jinping is now convinced winning local support is futile, writes Bill Birtles.Read more\"Hong Kong affairs are entirely China\\'s internal affairs that allow no foreign interference,\" he said.\"Establishing and improving a legal framework and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security in Hong Kong is in itself an embodiment of one country, two systems.\"It is to ensure the steady implementation of this principle as well as the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, which has been endorsed by all Chinese people, including our compatriots in Hong Kong, and most countries in the world.\"Both Hong Kong and Chinese central government officials have said the law is vital to plug gaping holes in Hong Kong\\'s national security defences — deficiencies exposed in the months of sometimes-violent protests that rocked the city in the past year.Hong Kong and Chinese officials have repeatedly said only a tiny number of people will be targeted by the new laws and that the rights and freedoms of ordinary people will not be affected.ABC/WiresPosted  1 JulJuly 2020WedWednesday 1 JulJuly 2020 at 5:16am, updated 1 JulJuly 2020WedWednesday 1 JulJuly 2020 at 4:06pmShareCopy linkFacebookTwitterArticle share optionsShare this onFacebookTwitterLinkedInSend this byEmailMessengerCopy linkWhatsAppRelated StoriesThe handover was a historic moment, but some Hongkongers in Australia say it sold out their futureChina reveals new national security law for Hong Kong to stop \\'terrorism\\' amid international condemnationHere\\'s what you need to know about the controversial laws Beijing is passing on Hong KongMore on:Hong KongChinaAsiaWorld PoliticsPolitics and GovernmentTerrorismDemonstrationLaw, Crime and JusticeForeign AffairsActivism and Lobbying'"
