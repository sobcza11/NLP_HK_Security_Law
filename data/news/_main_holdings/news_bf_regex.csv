bbc_1,2020-06-30,BBC,UK,Hong Kong security law: What is it and is it worrying?,"China has passed a wide-ranging new security law for Hong Kong which makes it easier to punish protesters and reduces the city's autonomy. Critics have called it ""the end of Hong Kong"" - so what do we know, and what do people fear the most? Hong Kong was always meant to have a security law, but could never pass one because it was so unpopular. So this is about China stepping in to ensure the city has a legal framework to deal with what it sees as serious challenges to its authority. The details of the law's 66 articles were kept secret until after it was passed. It criminalises any act of: secession - breaking away from the countrysubversion - undermining the power or authority of the central governmentterrorism - using violence or intimidation against peoplecollusion with foreign or external forces The law came into effect at 23:00 local time on 30 June, an hour before the 23rd anniversary of the city's handover to China from British rule. It gives Beijing powers to shape life in Hong Kong it has never had before. Critics say it effectively curtails protest and freedom of speech - China has said it will return stability. The new law's key provisions include that: Crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces are punishable by a maximum sentence of life in prisonDamaging public transport facilities can be considered terrorismThose found guilty will not be allowed to stand for public officeCompanies can be fined if convicted under the lawBeijing will establish a new security office in Hong Kong, with its own law enforcement personnel - neither of which would come under the local authority's jurisdictionThis office can send some cases to be tried in mainland China - but Beijing has said it will only have that power over a ""tiny number"" of cases  In addition, Hong Kong will have to establish its own national security commission to enforce the laws, with a Beijing-appointed adviser Hong Kong's chief executive will have the power to appoint judges to hear national security cases, raising fears about judicial autonomyImportantly, Beijing will have power over how the law should be interpreted, not any Hong Kong judicial or policy body. If the law conflicts with any Hong Kong law, the Beijing law takes prioritySome trials will be heard behind closed doors.People suspected of breaking the law can be wire-tapped and put under surveillanceManagement of foreign non-governmental organisations and news agencies will be strengthenedThe law will also apply to non-permanent residents and people ""from outside [Hong Kong]... who are not permanent residents of Hong Kong"". Only a handful of people had seen the full text of the law before it was enacted, a source of considerable controversy in Hong Kong. They did not include the territory's Chief Executive, Carrie Lam. She told the UN Human Rights Council hours before it came into force that it would fill a ""gaping hole"" and not undermine Hong Kong's autonomy or its independent judiciary. She also promised it would not be retroactive. Beijing has said Hong Kong should respect and protect rights and liberties while safeguarding national security - but many still fear the loss of Hong Kong's freedoms with this law. ""It is clear that the law will have a severe impact on freedom of expression, if not personal security, on the people of Hong Kong,"" Professor Johannes Chan, a legal scholar at the University of Hong Kong, told the BBC before the passage of the law. There are reports of people deleting Facebook posts, and concerns that candidates opposing the national security law will be disqualified from running in elections. Many are also afraid Hong Kong's judicial independence will be eroded and its judicial system will look increasingly similar to mainland China's. The city is the only common law jurisdiction in China. ""Effectively, they are imposing the People's Republic of China's criminal system onto the Hong Kong common law system, leaving them with complete discretion to decide who should fall into which system,"" says Professor Chan. Some pro-democracy activists - such as Joshua Wong - have been lobbying foreign governments to help their cause. Such campaigning could become a crime in the future. He has now quit his Demosisto party. People also worry that a threat to Hong Kong's liberties could affect its attractiveness as a leading global business hub and economic powerhouse. Hong Kong was handed back to China from British control in 1997, but under a unique agreement - a mini-constitution called the Basic Law and a so-called ""one country, two systems"" principle. They are supposed to protect certain freedoms for Hong Kong: freedom of assembly and speech, an independent judiciary and some democratic rights - freedoms that no other part of mainland China has. Under the same agreement, Hong Kong had to enact is own national security law - this was set out in Article 23 of the Basic Law - but it never happened because of its unpopularity. Then, last year, protests over an extradition law turned violent and evolved into a broader anti-China and pro-democracy movement. China doesn't want to see that happen again. Many might ask how China can do this if the city was supposed to have freedoms guaranteed under the handover agreement. The Basic Law says Chinese laws can't be applied in Hong Kong unless they are listed in a section called Annex III - there are already a few listed there, mostly uncontroversial and around foreign policy. These laws can be introduced by decree - which means they bypass the city's parliament.

bbc_2,2020-07-01,BBC,UK,Hong Kong's new security law: Why it scares people,"China has introduced a new national security law for Hong Kong. The BBC's Michael Bristow takes a closer look at the detail, and what it will mean in practice. Lawyers and legal experts have said China's national security law for Hong Kong will fundamentally change the territory's legal system. It introduces new crimes with severe penalties - up to life in prison - and allows mainland security personnel to legally operate in Hong Kong with impunity. The legislation gives Beijing extensive powers it has never had before to shape life in the territory far beyond the legal system. Analysis of the law by NPC Observer, a team of legal experts from the United States and Hong Kong, identified what they consider a number of worrying aspects. ""Its criminal provisions are worded in such a broad manner as to encompass a swath of what has so far been considered protected speech,"" said a posting on its website. Article 29 is perhaps an example of this broad wording. It states that anyone who conspires with foreigners to provoke ""hatred"" of the Chinese government, or the authorities in Hong Kong, could have committed a criminal offence. Does that include criticism of China's governing Communist Party? On Wednesday at a media briefing, Hong Kong's Justice Secretary Teresa Cheng was asked to define exactly what the provision means. She was unable to give a clear answer. Article 55 also contains vague language. UK makes citizenship offer to Hong Kong residentsUK asylum for ex-consulate worker 'tortured in China' It gives Chinese mainland security operatives the right to investigate some national security cases that are ""complex"", ""serious"" or ""difficult"". As the NPC Observer team note, these words are ""highly subjective and malleable"". Human rights organisations have pointed out how the law seems to undermine protections previously offered to defendants. Trials can be held in secret (Article 41) and without a jury (Article 46). Judges can be handpicked (Article 44) by Hong Kong's chief executive, who is answerable directly to Beijing. The law also reverses a presumption that suspects will be granted bail (Article 42). That same provision also appears to suggest there is no time limit on how long suspects can be held. It says only that cases should be handled in a ""timely manner"". THE TEXT: What it is and why Hong Kong is worriedWHAT COULD HAPPEN: Life sentences for breaking the law and moreRESIDENTS REACT: 'End of one country, two systems'PRO-DEMOCRACY MOVEMENT: Minutes after new law, voices quit Entire cases - from investigation to judgement to punishment - can be simply handed over to the mainland authorities (Article 56). Foreign nationals outside of Hong Kong face prosecution under the law (Article 38). Donald Clarke, writing for the China Collection, a blog focusing on Chinese issues, wrote that a US newspaper columnist advocating Tibetan independence might fall foul of the law. ""If you've ever said anything that might offend the PRC (People's Republic of China) or Hong Kong authorities, stay out of Hong Kong,"" he wrote. Mr Clarke, of the George Washington University Law School, said the biggest worry was the institutions and processes that the law has established. The legislation allows China to set up the Office for Safeguarding National Security in Hong Kong - a mainland Chinese body to be staffed by mainland Chinese personnel. Article 60 makes it clear that anyone who works there does not have to abide by Hong Kong's laws. They shall not be subject to ""inspection, search or detention"". As Mr Clarke wrote: ""They are untouchable."" Claudia Mo, an opposition lawmaker in Hong Kong, said the aim of China's national security legislation was to ""stun Hong Kong into nothingness"". ""People will be so petrified, so frightened and intimidated, that they wouldn't dare say anything or do anything in opposition,"" she said. Of course, that is not the view in Beijing. Zhang Xiaoming, of China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, said on Wednesday that the law would help return stability to the territory. It will bring Hong Kong more in line with the laws, procedures and practices of mainland China. Whether or not you think the legislation was necessary, it is impossible to deny its significance. As Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam put it: this is a turning point.",5324
nytimes_5,2020-06-28,NY Times,US,What China’s New National Security Law Means for Hong Kong,"Chinese lawmakers have approved a national security law, drastically curbing political protest and dissent in Hong Kong and adding to Beijing’s tensions with Western powers.The National People’s Congress Standing Committee — an arm of China’s Communist Party-run legislature — discussed the draft law twice this month, including a three-day session that started on Sunday. But even as Hong Kong news media reported on Tuesday that the law had passed, the city’s residents were still waiting to see its full text. Here is what the move means for Hong Kong.A law to curb opposition in Hong Kong. China’s Communist Party leaders have long worried about opposition to their rule in Hong Kong, which was a British colony until 1997. The Basic Law, which enshrines Hong Kong’s special legal status, says the semiautonomous territory should enact legislation that outlaws “any act of treason, secession, sedition, subversion.” Full details have not been released, but the security law is expected to deter speech, protests and news media critical of the Chinese government, threatening the territory’s independent press and democratic opposition.Many Hong Kong residents are proudly protective of their rights under the territory’s separate legal system and have opposed attempts to pass such legislation. A previous push by Hong Kong’s leaders to enact a national security law foundered in 2003 after nearly 500,000 people joined a street protest against it.China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, has been impatient to impose control over Hong Kong. After the territory erupted in monthslong protests last year over a proposed extradition law, a Communist Party meeting in October demanded steps to “safeguard national security” in Hong Kong.The National People’s Congress Standing Committee usually meets every two months or so. This time, the committee met just a little over a week after it first discussed the security legislation at its last session. The timing of the latest session suggested that Mr. Xi wanted the law passed before July 1, the 23rd anniversary of Hong Kong’s return to Chinese sovereignty. Beijing imposes security agencies. Legal experts had been uncertain how Mr. Xi could introduce a national security law into Hong Kong without going through the city’s Legislative Council, a body stacked with pro-Beijing members who have, nonetheless, hesitated to take such a contentious step.But Mr. Xi made a bold move to break the impasse in May, when a full session of the National People’s Congress nearly unanimously passed a resolution empowering the Congress’s Standing Committee to bring state security legislation into the Basic Law.The central government’s decision to impose a law effectively circumvents the Hong Kong legislature. Even Hong Kong politicians who have endorsed the law, including the territory’s top official, Carrie Lam, have said they have not been shown the full text by Beijing, which will bring into Hong Kong new crimes like inciting separatism and “colluding with foreign powers.”The law will also establish a new security agency in the territory to enforce the security restrictions, and Beijing will create its own separate security arm in Hong Kong, empowered to investigate special cases and collect intelligence, according to a summary issued by China’s legislature.The legislation also gives the territory’s chief official, who must answer to Beijing, the power to decide which judges are empowered to hear trials for state security charges, limiting the autonomy of the city’s judiciary.Many residents fear the law. Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s local leader, has sought to reassure the public that their “legitimate rights and freedoms” will be safeguarded. She and other politicians who support the law have also said that it will target only a tiny minority of lawbreakers.Pro-democracy activists have denounced the proposed law, and the Hong Kong Bar Association has called it unconstitutional.The Hong Kong police force has denied applications from three groups — the League of Social Democrats, the Civil Human Rights Front and pro-democracy district officials — to hold marches opposing the law on July 1, the politically sensitive anniversary of Hong Kong’s handover to Chinese rule, citing risks from the coronavirus and dangers of violence. If the police decision survives appeal, it would be the first time since 2003 that a march on July 1 has been banned, the Civil Human Rights Front said. Some protesters may ignore the order and march.A survey by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute in mid-June found that 49 percent of respondents “very much oppose” the security legislation, while another 7 percent “somewhat oppose” it, Reuters reported. But the survey also indicated that public backing for street demonstrations had softened: Support for protests fell to 51 percent, down from 58 percent in a poll in March.Western governments object. As China moved forward with plans to impose security laws in Hong Kong, foreign governments criticized the decision. Foreign ministers from the Group of 7 leading industrialized democracies called on China this month to abandon the law, saying that it would undermine the autonomy of the territory.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday that the United States would impose visa restrictions on Chinese officials, including retired ones “believed to be responsible for, or complicit in, undermining Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy.” He did not name any officials or say how many might be barred. Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain has promised to allow nearly three million people from Hong Kong to live and work in the country. Mr. Johnson, however, has left unanswered questions about how those admitted might be able to obtain British citizenship.Taiwan said this month that it would expand efforts to provide refuge to protesters and others who wish to leave Hong Kong. The government said it could, in certain cases, provide work and study visas, as well as assistance securing housing and jobs.",6021

 Authorities in Hong Kong made the first arrests under the new controversial national security law Wednesday after thousands gathered for an annual pro-democracy rally to mark the anniversary of Hong Kong’s handover to China 23 years ago.

KEY FACTS


Police arrested 370 people Wednesday during the city’s largest protest in months in defiance of Covid-19 restrictions; of those arrests, 10 were reportedly arrested for breaking the new law, according to the Wall Street Journal. 


The national security law, adopted Tuesday in Beijing, passed after the widespread protests in Hong Kong last year and allows authorities to crack down on dissenters with long jail sentences for charges that experts say are defined in vague terms that could allow for broad interpretation by China.



Critics of the new law say it effectively ends the autonomy of Hong Kong, which has existed under a ""one country, two systems"" agreement since the British gave Hong Kong back to China in 1997, which occurred 23 years ago from Wednesday.



The new law has been condemned globally; on Tuesday, U.S. Congress introduced a bipartisan bill that would give some Hong Kongers refugee status.


British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has made an offer to allow the  3 million Hong Kong citizens eligible for a British overseas passport a pathway to citizenship.


China has defended the new law, saying it is essential to restore peace in Hong Kong and that it would not permit domestic policies to be swayed by foreign influence. 


TANGENT
The new law has had a chilling effect on pro-democracy activism in Hong Kong. Several activist groups have already disbanded as a result of the new laws. According to the New York Times, a Hong Kong museum dedicated to preserving the memory of the 1989 massacre in Tienanmen Square is working to quickly digitize its collection in case authorities come to take their archive.
KEY BACKGROUND
The law lists charges like subversion, secession and terrorism as carrying punishments up to life in prison. Causing damage to public transportation, as was commonly seen during protests last year, could be grounds for a terrorism charge, according to the BBC. The law allows for more serious offenses to be extradited to China to be heard by Chinese courts, drawing comparisons to the extradition bill that kicked off the protests last year that was later withdrawn. China can even waive a trial by jury and restrict access to trials. It also permits Beijing to set up a new security agency in Hong Kong to keep an eye on the enforcement of the new law that is above judicial review or existing Hong Kong laws. The new law also applies to non-Hong Kong residents living abroad, which means foreigners found in violation could be arrested as soon as they step foot in Hong Kong according to the BBC.

Thursday, July 30, marked one month since China's new national security law came into force in Hong Kong.From June 30, China has wielded the power to define and punish ""separatism, subversion, terrorism and foreign interference"" in the city as it sees fit. This means that anti-China sentiment — be it waving banners, attending protests, posting on social media, or calling for foreign intervention — is no longer tolerated.The law effectively marks the end of Hong Kong's political autonomy from the mainland. The crackdown has been swift and often violent, but pro-democracy activists haven't lost all hope.

Here's what's happened in the month since.Political groups disbanded as activists fled to safetyShortly after the law came into force, four major pro-democracy figures — Joshua Wong, Agnes Chow, Nathan Law, and Jeffrey Ngo — resigned as leaders of the Demosistō organization, fearing that their titles would see them imprisoned.Hours later, Demosistō said the entire organization was disbanding. The Hong Kong National Front, another significant pro-independence group, disbanded soon after.

Nathan Law, a local politician and co-founder of Demosistō, announced on July 3 that he had fled Hong Kong. He revealed on July 13 that he was living in London.

Also in London is Simon Cheng, a campaigner and former British consulate employee in Hong Kong, who was detained for 15 days during a trip to mainland China last year. Cheng said he was tortured by Chinese agents.Cheng has since announced intentions to set up a parliament-in-exile with other activists who have fled.""A shadow parliament can send a very clear signal to Beijing,"" he told Reuters in early July.Public libraries in Hong Kong have also removed books written by pro-democracy activists from their shelves and catalogues.

Police used the law to justify arrests right awayOn the first day of the national-security law's existence, 300 protesters were arrested by the Hong Kong police. Nine of the arrests were on suspicion of violating the national security, which forbids secession, the police said. The vague wording of the law gives police vast discretion to arrest people. Participating in demonstrations and waving anti-China slogans were good enough reasons for them to detain protesters.The full text of law was not even made public until several days after it had been passed. Leading figures arrestedFour students and activists aged between 16 and 21 were arrested on Thursday for ""inciting secession"" on social media — a charge that could see them spend the rest of their lives in jail.

The Hong Kong Police Force said the quartet had announced on social media that they were setting up a pro-independence organisation, according to the BBC. They were detained for ""inciting secession.""The arrests appear to be the first that specifically target Hong Kong's activists.

A key election postponed, with opposition barredTwelve pro-democracy political candidates, including Joshua Wong and Dennis Kwok, were barred from running in Hong Kong's legislative election, which was scheduled in September.The elections had been the pro-democracy movement's best — and perhaps final — chance to combat China's growing encroachment on the city's political autonomy after the security law was imposed.

China's liaison office in Hong Kong said the candidates had lobbied ""foreign powers to put sanctions on Hong Kong"" and tried to derail the passing of the security law. Colluding with foreign forces are one of the serious infractions detailed in the law.To make matters worse for the democracy movement, Hong Kong's government on Friday said it was delaying the election set for September by a year, citing concerns over the coronavirus.

But pro-democracy politicians still have hopeShortly after being barred from running in future legislative elections, senior members of the pro-democracy Civic Party said they would not lose heart.""When the regime wishes to enslave us, the best thing to do is to stand firm and tell the regime we would not change,"" said Kwok Ka-ki, one of the members, according to local news channel RTHK.

On July 11 — less than two weeks after the security law was imposed — 600,000 Hong Kongers risked their safety to vote for the pro-democracy candidates they wanted to run in the (now postponed) legislative elections.New forms of resistanceHolding protest signs and chanting anti-China slogans are forbidden under the national-security law. Carrying a banner reading ""Free Hong Kong,"" for example, could get you imprisoned now.However, protesters were quick to adopt a new banner of independence: Sheets of white posters with no slogans of symbols that could see them breach the law.Activists have also changed the words to popular independence chants to avoid falling afoul of the security law. During a protest earlier this month, a group of protesters replaced the words in the protest anthem ""Glory to Hong Kong"" with numbers, RTHK reported.

Courts in mainland China will have the power to hear some national security cases from Hong Kong.(AP: Vincent Yu)Early assessments of the law suggest some elements are stronger than many feared, both in scope and penalties.The crimes of secession, subversion of state power, terrorism and colluding with foreign countries and external elements — such as foreign institutions, organisations and personnel — could result in penalties of up to life in prison.Hong Kong protests explainedThe complicated conflict broken down in simple terms to help you get a handle on what's going on Read moreThis has stunned some legal scholars, who say even peaceful actions such as the pro-democracy Occupy protests of 2014 could now bring 10 years' jail if foreign links could be proven.It also provides for more active state management and oversight of foreign groups, organisations and media based in Hong Kong, which has for decades been China's freest and most international city.It demands disqualification for elected politicians who breach the law, a move certain to rile democracy activists in the run-up to crucial elections for Hong Kong's Legislative Council in September. Molotov cocktails were used by some violent protesters. Arson is now listed as a terror offence.(Reuters: Athit Perawongmetha)And while the laws will not be applied retroactively against crimes committed before it was implemented, some of the actions of those who took part in the violent protests that have rocked Hong Kong over the past 12 months may now constitute terror offences.Terror offences:Severe violence against peopleExplosions, arson or the release of pathogens, poisons and other substancesDestruction of vehicles, public transport, power and gas equipment, or other flammable and explosive equipmentSeverely disrupting and destroying electronic control systems for public services like water, power, transportation and communicationsUsing other dangerous methods to seriously endanger public health of safetyDamaging public transport would be considered a terror offence, and damaging government buildings would also be a serious offence.One major concern is that the legislation allows mainland Chinese security and intelligence agents to operate in Hong Kong on an official basis, and gives them powers that go beyond local laws.These agents will be allowed to carry out surveillance of people suspected of endangering national security, including through the use of wiretaps, and cannot be detained or inspected by local authorities while carrying out their duties.The intelligence agents will have a new base in the city at a mainland security commission, while Hong Kong's Government will also have its own commission, backed by a special police unit.Up until now, Hong Kong has boasted a proudly independent judiciary and a separate, common-law-based legal system — but that will also face unprecedented pressure under the new law.The national security law allows Hong Kong's chief executive to appoint judges for national security cases, and lets mainland courts hear serious and complex Hong Kong cases in certain situations. Protesters stormed Hong Kong's legislature last year during the protests: such actions would now fall under the national security law.(AP: Kin Cheung)These include cases allegedly involving collusion with foreign forces, but it's still not known how suspects will be taken to the mainland, given Hong Kong has no formal extradition arrangements with Beijing.There is also a provision allowing for trials to take place secretly, barring public and media access to proceedings, if the case involves ""state secrets or public order"". However judgements must be publicised.Media organisations that publish articles or images about things judged to be terror offences could be prosecuted under a section that bans promoting or inciting terrorist activities.What has the local reaction been? Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's pro-Beijing chief executive, is a supporter of the law.(Reuters: Tyrone Siu)Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam says mainland national security laws are long overdue for the territory.But many in the city are waiting to see if action will be swift or whether authorities will wait to test their new institutions and cautiously build cases.Some high-profile democracy and independence activists have said they expected to become the first to be detained under the new regime, and as a result chose to disband their groups.LoadingWithin two hours of the law being announced, the Government revealed special local police and justice department prosecution units had already been formed to enforce the law.Fear has been building in some political, activist, academic, religious and business circles and some predict that, beyond high-profile cases, the law will chill the openness that they have taken for granted. Some say privately they are questioning whether they should leave Hong Kong.""The punitive elements of the law are stupefying,"" Simon Young, a law professor at the University of Hong Kong's law school, and a barrister, told Reuters.""Let us hope no-one tries to test this law, for the consequences to the individual and the legal system will be irreparable.""What has the international community said?

cnn_11,2020-07-03,CNN,US,Hong Kong's security law could have a chilling effect on press freedom,"London (CNN Business)Hong Kong insists its vibrant community of journalists has nothing to fear from the national security legislation China imposed on the city this week. But press freedom advocates worry about creeping self-censorship, and there are signs that the new law may already be having a chilling effect.In what was once seen as a safe haven of free speech for local and foreign news organizations operating in the region, journalists and their sources are growing increasingly wary that as China takes a firmer grip on Hong Kong, they could be prosecuted. The new law applies to any person in Hong Kong, both locals and foreign nationals. It criminalizes actions like calling for Hong Kong independence, or working with a foreign entity ""to incite hatred"" toward the Chinese government. A new enforcement committee will ""strengthen the management"" of NGOs and media working in Hong Kong. The police will also have new powers to search premises, wiretap suspects and order people to ""delete information or provide assistance."" Article 4 of the law says ""the freedoms of speech, of the press, of publication, of association, of assembly, of procession and of demonstration"" will be protected. But it also criminalizes the leaking of ""state secrets,"" a vague term commonly used in China to cover a range of issues deemed to be in the national interest and which has been used in the past to imprison journalists like Gao Yu on the mainland. That could deter both journalists and sources from reporting or collaborating on stories relating to government affairs. Why China's national security law could change Hong Kong foreverHong Kong holds a unique position in the region, as it is home to the only free press in any area or territory administered by the Chinese government. But there's been no clear guidance on what the new security law means for the city's long-established media community.Read MoreDeliberate ambiguity That the legislation lacks specifics is deliberate, not an omission, according to experts such as Sophie Richardson, China Director of Human Rights Watch (HRW).""This law is so vague and so overboard that it could potentially apply to just about any kind of behavior or speech and that's exactly the Chinese government's goal: It wants everyone to start and think 'Oh wait a minute does this constitute sedition? Oh wait a minute, is that collusion?'"" Richardson said. The vague nature of the law will lead to self-censorship, which may be precisely what Beijing wants, said Steven Butler, Asia director for the Committee To Protect Journalists (CPJ).""The Chinese Communist Party may achieve what it wants to achieve without ever having to enforce the law,"" he said.Both Butler and Richardson said the new law could bring Hong Kong more in line with how the media is treated in China, one of the worst countries in the world for press freedom according to Reporters Without Borders and where self-censorship is commonplace.How the national security law is bringing China's authoritarian legal system to Hong KongHong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam has asserted that it won't affect freedom of speech, enshrined in the city's 1997 de facto constitution called the Basic Law. But the new law may supersede such protections, Butler said.When asked by CNN in a press conference on Wednesday whether people would be allowed to criticize the new law, Lam said: ""If individuals including reporters from CNN are discharging their role and feel something is not right and want to criticize then I don't see why that would be an offense under this law.""But, she warned, ""If there is more, if you are involved in organizing or colluding that's another matter. It's a question of evidence and the law.""Dire consequences?Press freedoms in Hong Kong have been under pressure in recent years, Butler said, adding that reporters covering pro-democracy protests in the city have been targeted by police. In 2018, the Financial Times' Asia news editor Victor Mallet was denied a routine extension of his visa, months after he moderated a debate at the Foreign Correspondents' Club that featured a pro-independence activist.For journalists who are Hong Kong citizens, the consequences of breaking the new law could be dire. They could be tried behind closed doors and sentenced to life imprisonment. Those found guilty of participating or assisting in crimes can also face between three and 10 years in jail. Hong Kong authorities have not outlined any specifics on how the new enforcement committee for managing media will affect foreign reporters, who — unlike their counterparts in mainland China — do not require specific journalist visas. China hits back at US with new media restrictions as tensions riseThose visas for foreign reporters in mainland China come with strict oversight and the government has in the past expelled journalists, including around a dozen recently from the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post.Then there are the sources and interview subjects, many of whom are likely to be even more wary of speaking to the media — something reporters in mainland China already struggle with, HRW's Richardson said.Butler, at the CPJ, said in recent days that journalists have already been asked by sources and interview subjects to delete previous articles or communications with sources that could be viewed as seditious. CNN, which has a major bureau in the city, has spoken to sources who have expressed reluctance to participate in interviews. Within hours of the bill's passage, sources asked that past WhatsApp chats be deleted and expressed caution about being quoted in articles about the law.Waiting for 'test' casesButler and Richardson said it is only a matter of time before there is a ""test case,"" where a reporter will be tried under the new law. ""I won't be surprised if some journalists wind up being charged under this law at some point in the not too distant future,"" Richardson said. For now, news organizations and press freedom advocates can only try to lobby the Hong Kong government.Security law could hurt Hong Kong as a global business hub""Hong Kong has been a leader in supporting the rights of a free press in Asia for decades and it is essential that it continues to do so, particularly given the treatment of members of the independent press within mainland China and the global nature of the coronavirus pandemic,"" a New York Times spokesperson told CNN Business, adding that it is closely monitoring the situation. Butler said he hopes Hong Kong's status as a financial center and an important Asian gateway for Western companies will protect its press freedoms. ""You can't have an international finance center without freedom of the speech and press,"" he said.",2960
nypost_8,2020-07-01,NY Post,US,Hong Kong police arrest over 300 in first protest under new security law,"Hong Kong police arrested more than 300 people Wednesday as thousands of defiant demonstrators gathered in Hong Kong to protest Beijing’s new national security law — while the UK offered a new path to citizenship for almost 3 million eligible residents of its former colony., Hong Kong police fired water cannon and tear gas as protesters took to the streets to vent against the sweeping security legislation introduced by China that they say is aimed at stifling dissent., In Causeway Bay, the retail center of the island territory, cops raised a flag warning crowds they were violating the new law, but pro-Democracy demonstrators still gathered, resulting in hundreds of arrests by nightfall., Protesters remained undaunted., “We are on street to [protest] against national security law. We shall never surrender. Now is not the time to give up,” tweeted Joshua Wong, a Hong Kong activist with more than 600,000 followers on Twitter.’, Reuters, On the first full day the tough new law was in place, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam admitted the civil unrest that had rocked the city for months last year was sparked by past failures, but claimed that the national security law showed “Beijing’s confidence” in the city, the South China Morning Post reported., Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the path to citizenship because, he said, Hong Kong residents’ freedoms were being erased by the new law., “It violates Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy and threatens the freedoms and rights protected by the joint declaration,” Johnson said, the BBC reported., “We made clear that if China continued down this path we would introduce a new route for those with British National [Overseas] status to enter the UK, granting them limited leave to remain with the ability to live and work in the UK and thereafter to apply for citizenship. And that is precisely what we will do now.”, Riot police stop and search people.Reuters, About 350,000 UK passport holders, and 2.6 million others who are eligible, will be able to come to the UK for five years, and after a further year, they can apply for citizenship., British National Overseas Passport holders in Hong Kong were granted special status in the 1980s but until now had restricted rights and were only entitled to visa-free access to the UK for six months., Johnson also said Tuesday’s passing of the law was a “clear and serious breach” of the 1985 Sino-British joint declaration — which set out how certain freedoms would be protected for the 50 years after China assumed control of the colony in 1997, the news service reported., Hong Kong’s autonomy was guaranteed under the “one country, two systems” agreement enshrined in the Sino-British Joint Declaration signed by then Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher., Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said Britain had carefully assessed China’s national security legislation since it was published late on Tuesday., “It constitutes a clear violation of the autonomy of Hong Kong, and a direct threat to the freedoms of its people, and therefore I’m afraid to say it is a clear and serious violation of the Joint Declaration treaty between the United Kingdom and China,” Raab told Reuters and the BBC., Authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong have repeatedly said the legislation is aimed at a few “troublemakers” and will not affect rights and freedoms, nor investor interests., “China, through this national security legislation, is not living up to its promises to the people of Hong Kong,” Raab said. “We will live up to our promises.”, Asked about how the West should deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Raab said the international community needed to act., Riot police fire tear gas into the crowds to disperse anti-national security law protesters.Reuters, “Obviously, China is a leading member of the international community. And it is precisely because of that, that we expect it to live up to its international obligations and its international responsibilities. For trust in China’s ability to do that, today has been a big step backwards.”, In response to the crackdown, the US said it would no longer deliver certain weapons to Hong Kong for fear they would fall into the hands of the mainland’s Communist government.",16593
nippon_9,2020-08-14,Nippon,Japan,Hong Kong’s Security Law: How Should Japan Respond?,"Growing Private and Governmental Support for Hong Kong Democracy, Members of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of China in Beijing held a vote on June 30 on the Law of the People’s Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and it passed unanimously. This National Security Law was immediately added to Annex III of Hong Kong’s Basic Law. At a press conference the next day, Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga Yoshihide called the law “regrettable.”, However, others in Japan have offered more direct support on the issue. As Hong Kong marked one year from the million-strong protest against an amended extradition bill, which would have allowed suspects in the territory to be sent to China for trial, on June 9, various nongovernmental organizations hosted an online symposium from Tokyo’s National Diet Building’s Chamber of the House of Representatives, titled “Global Solidarity: From Hong Kong to the International Order.”, The symposium had a remote link to Hong Kong allowing democracy activist Agnes Chow Ting and prodemocracy District Councilor Sam Yip to speak, and the venue had displays of gasmasks used by demonstrators, empty tear-gas canisters, and protest signs. There was also a gallery of images of the demonstrations taken by a Japanese photographer, and during the lectures, participants discussed the difficulties faced by democracy supporters in Hong Kong., Protests against the National Security Law continue there, and Hong Kong citizens working and staying in Japan also came to carry signs and chant in support at the venue. Cheung, a citizen of Hong Kong who works in Tokyo, said, “It’s incredibly ironic that the Chinese government used the phrase ‘collusion with foreign forces’ in the law, because lots of government officials in Hong Kong hold British passports, or are dual citizens of Australia, New Zealand, or Canada. At the same time, if you look at all the young protestors, everyone born after the reversion of Hong Kong to China in 1997 only has Hong Kong citizenship. So, all of those government officials are really the foreign colluders.”, David, another citizen of the territory who attends school in Tokyo, says, “Hong Kong has been influenced by Western values since it opened up in the nineteenth century. If they want to talk about collusion with foreign powers, it’s been going on for 150 years, hasn’t it?” he says, with a grimace. “Hong Kong has been a place where Western and Chinese culture have mixed for 150 years. It has preserved its traditional Chinese culture, but it must also continue to value Western-style freedom, democracy, and human rights.” The protestors are simply asking that the Chinese government keep its original promise to Hong Kong., A scene from the “Global Solidarity” symposium held in Tokyo. Displays at the venue included gasmasks used by demonstrators, and empty tear-gas canisters., Japan to Lure Hong Kong Financial Workers, The passage of the new National Security Law threatens the future of the “one country, two systems” principle, and Taiwan, former colonial administrator Britain, and a number of Western countries have begun contemplating measures to aid those in Hong Kong who still hunger for freedom and democracy. The ideas are varied, and include extending Hong Kongers’ periods of stay for study or work, or supporting highly skilled immigrants. On June 11, at a meeting of the Budget Committee of the House of Councilors, Prime Minister Abe Shinzō said that he wants to promote the inflow of talented people from Hong Kong, particularly those in finance. Many Hong Kong citizens may come to Japan to take advantage of this chance if the district faces a future crisis., “I’m grateful to the Japanese government for offering more opportunities to Hong Kong’s people, but at the same time what we really need is attention and support from the international community. No one wants to have to choose exile. We want Hong Kong to be free from that necessity,” says Cheung, who goes on to describe the plight of many young people in the territory. “Honestly, most of the Hong Kongers who have skill in finance have already emigrated to other countries. The people who need help are those in their teens and twenties, who were born after 1997. They don’t have any savings, or hope for the future. I want the international community to focus on that generation.”, At the June 9 symposium, Japanese attendees included members of the lower house of the Diet. Some of them proposed more active support for democracy in Hong Kong from the Japanese government. One petitioner expressed pessimism, though. “If the Japanese government were already being more active, there would be no need for us to be talking like this now.”, Ever since the 2019 demonstrations, Japan has been far more reserved in its response than Western nations. On October 23, 2019, Prime Minister Abe held a joint press conference with China’s Vice President Wang Qishan, expressing deep concern over the situation in the territory while stressing the importance of allowing a free and open Hong Kong to flourish under the “two systems” principle., However, the true focus of that meeting for both sides was on high-profile incidents involving the detention of Japanese scholars in China and the intrusion of Chinese ships into Japan’s waters near the Senkaku Islands. Vice President Wang’s visit also involved his attendance at the accession ceremonies for the new emperor and empress as the special envoy of President Xi Jinping. So neither side was interested in in-depth discussion., Hong Kong democracy activist Agnes Chow joined the “Global Solidarity” symposium by remote link., China’s Hard-Line Push Exceeds International Expectations, Hong Kong began attracting more international attention from the end of May 2020, as the debate on the National Security Law grew in intensity. On June 19, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress amended its draft of the law. The draft originally included a provision to prevent, restrain, and punish “interference of foreign nations and foreign collusion in matters of Hong Kong,” but this was changed to “collusion with foreign countries or foreign forces,” reawakening public controversy. Many Hong Kong officials, including Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng, say they were not informed of Beijing’s revisions in advance., The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic caused the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference scheduled for April 29 to be rescheduled for May 22. However, the unwavering insistence of China’s authorities on pushing through the Hong Kong National Security Law, and the speed of their revisions, exceeded the imagination of all observers. At the same time, there has been no sign of easing in any of the various conflicts that have continued since the first demonstrations against the 2019 extradition bill. Considering how much progress China’s administration has made toward bringing about the end of the “two systems” structure in a single month, it’s easy to imagine how quickly that end will arrive when Beijing decides its time has come., Hong Kong’s government is clearly already suffering from a loss of independence, and Chinese interference has stripped it of the ability to interpret laws on its own. Hong Kong’s Sing Tao Daily newspaper, considered a pro-China voice, reports that Hong Kong’s Chief Executive Carrie Lam went to Beijing while the National Security Law was being debated to receive a copy of the draft directly from the central authority, but was rebuffed at the door. It appears that Chinese government is taking advantage of the chaos caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, when so many countries have closed their borders, to advance its political agenda by forcing adoption of the National Security Law sight unseen., The Tokyo symposium featured a display of photos of the demonstrations taken by a Japanese photographer., Can Japan Pass This Test?, As the people of Hong Kong continue their protests, and every nation in the world is dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, the most important point in this fight could be the G7 summit, where the leaders of seven of the world’s most developed nations will meet to discuss the shape of the post-pandemic world. (Originally slated for June, the summit has been postponed until September or later due to the COVID-19 crisis.), On June 18, the G7 foreign ministers issued a joint statement expressing “grave concern” over the issues in Hong Kong. As Japan’s posture becomes even more prominent, Prime Minister Abe said that Japan wants to take the lead in crafting the G7 leaders’ statement on the situation, thus signaling a new attitude from Japan., China was naturally unhappy with these developments, and the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a response to Japan’s moves and the G7 foreign ministers’ communiqué: “China firmly opposes the G7 Foreign Ministers’ Statement on Hong Kong, which wantonly comments on Hong Kong affairs.” The Chinese government also declared its unwavering intention to continue with implementation and enforcement of the National Security Law. Japan is the only Asian member of the G7, but its power to press the rest of the membership on this topic is limited, and with the unpredictability of China’s leaders and the delicacy of arranging their official visits to Japan, Tokyo is taking an increasingly cautious stance., Japan’s position is complicated still more by its position between the United States and China, requiring it to maintain balance. In recent years, China’s diplomatic ties with Japan have improved somewhat. That calls to mind the late 1980s, when Japan had been more successful than most in helping China to reduce its deficits and approach a more even balance of trade with Japan as the nation pressed ahead with its “reform and opening” policy. After the Chinese authorities forcibly suppressed the student protests at Tiananmen Square in 1989, they faced fierce international criticism, but Japan took the lead in calling on world leaders to refrain from isolating China. This thaw culminated in the 1992 visit to China by Emperor Akihito. In the three decades since then, though, China has taken advantage of Japan’s tolerant attitude in diplomacy. Whenever quarrels or conflicts arise between the two countries, Chinese authorities use anti-Japanese sentiment to stoke nationalism., In the end, the G7 summit will likely serve as the final court of appeal to the international community on the issue of China’s forced instatement of the Hong Kong National Security Law, and as such will be yet another venue for the views of China and the West to clash. When that happens, Japan will be put in an even more difficult position. Japan shares the values of the other, Western, G7 nations. It will have to express concerns over the Hong Kong National Security Law’s violations of human rights and freedom, although this could not only worsen relations with China but also have further impacts on the Olympic games and economic activity. Japan-China relations are going to come to a head with this year’s summit., In short, the Japanese government is going to have to show stronger resolve along with all the nations of the G7. Afterward, Japan-China relations are sure to suffer, and with that comes a strong possibility that China will ramp up its infringements in Japanese maritime territory. But Japan simply must stand its ground at this point. It cannot carry on its traditionally vague stance in a post-COVID-19 international order. The issue of Hong Kong’s National Security Law is a test case for this, as Taiwan will be for future US-China relations. The issue of the National Security Law is a straightforward example of the clash of national interests between China and the Western order, including Japan.",6744
bbc_18,2020-06-30,BBC,UK,Hong Kong security law: Anger as China's Xi signs legislation,"The UK, EU and Nato have expressed concern and anger after China passed a controversial security law giving it new powers over Hong Kong. The law makes secession, subversion of the central government, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces punishable by up to life in prison. It took effect from 2300 local time (1500 GMT) on Tuesday. Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam defended the law, saying it filled a ""gaping hole"" in national security. One key pro-democracy group said it was now ceasing all operations. Demosisto announced the move on Facebook after Joshua Wong, one of Hong Kong's most prominent activists, said he was leaving the group, which he had spearheaded. Minutes after new law, pro-democracy voices quit The law has come into effect just a day before the 23rd anniversary of the return of sovereignty to China - a day that usually draws large pro-democracy protests. China says the law is needed to tackle unrest and instability linked to a broadening pro-democracy movement. China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried?The city of two masks faces a new crisis Opponents say it undermines the autonomy set out in Hong Kong's mini-constitution, the Basic Law, which was agreed when the territory's sovereignty was returned by the UK in 1997. Civil liberties such as free speech, the right to protest and an independent and robust judiciary are at risk, they say. There has been a mixture of concern for personal safety and defiance at the news. Demosisto said several members had asked to be delisted and it had decided to ""dissolve and stop all meetings"". It said that the fight against ""totalitarian oppression"" would have to continue in a ""more flexible manner"". Joshua Wong said the law marked ""the end of Hong Kong that the world knew before"". Hong Kong's year in seven intense emotionsThe background you need on Hong Kong's protests But Democratic Party leader Wu Chi-wai said he would defy a ban on a ""handover day"" march scheduled for Wednesday, the South China Morning Post reports. He will be joined by Figo Chan, of the Civil Human Rights Front, who urged people to take to the streets, saying: ""We are aware of the risks of being prosecuted. But we insist on taking the lead, as we want to tell Hongkongers not to fear."" Police plan to have 4,000 riot officers on standby. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab urged China to ""step back from the brink"" and respect the rights of the people of Hong Kong. He said: ""The success of Hong Kong, the entrepreneurial spirit, the vibrancy, the economic success, has been built on its autonomy in 'one country, two systems'... That clearly is at threat."" What is the BNO and what does the UK move mean? The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, said: ""It risks seriously undermining the high degree of autonomy of Hong Kong and will have a detrimental impact on the judiciary and the rule of law and we deplore this decision."" The last UK governor of Hong Kong, Lord Patten, said the law marked the end of one-country, two-systems. Meanwhile, Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said: ""It is clear that China does not share our values - democracy, freedom, and the rule of law."" Japan called the law ""regrettable"" and Taiwan even warned its citizens of risks in visiting Hong Kong. The US has already begun taking steps to end Hong Kong's special status trade relationship, a move China on Tuesday said would be met with unspecified ""countermeasures"". Analysis by Stephen McDonell, BBC China correspondent Hong Kong's sweeping new security law is a frighteningly open-ended tool to suppress political agitation. Like similar laws on the Chinese mainland it appears that it can be manipulated to meet the needs of the Communist Party as required to crush almost any action deemed threatening. Unlike elsewhere in China, Hong Kong has an independent judiciary. For this reason, the Party's leadership was not going to leave interpretation of this law in the hands of just any old judges. No. Those who'll be allowed to preside in these matters will be hand-picked by Carrie Lam, the city's leader who was effectively installed by Beijing. So, prior to the new security bill, which actions by activists - no matter how subversive - could not be dealt with under existing laws? What were ""extremists"" getting away with to warrant this new legislation? Bomb making? No. Smashing up buildings? No. Meeting with international NGOs to talk about the city's deteriorating freedoms? Ahhhh. Perhaps. Publicly advocating Hong Kong independence? Almost certainly. The more that Beijing, under Xi Jinping's leadership, has sought to control Hong Kong, the more it has driven residents into the pro-democracy camp. But he is playing a long game. Sure, handover promises to the UK were made but he was not going to let some Western attachment to liberty trump loyalty to the motherland. Not on his watch. Enter the security law. The law, announced by Beijing in May, will make criminal any act of secession, subversion of the central government, terrorism or collusion with foreign or external forces. State news agency Xinhua said the six-chapter law had 66 articles, clearly setting out the terms of the four offences. Beijing to set up new security office in Hong Kong A new office in Hong Kong will deal with national security cases, but will also have other powers such as overseeing education about national security in Hong Kong schools. In addition, the city will have to establish its own national security commission to enforce the laws, with a Beijing-appointed adviser. Hong Kong's chief executive will have the power to appoint judges to hear national security cases, a move which has raised fears about judicial independence. Importantly, Beijing will have power over how the law should be interpreted. If the law conflicts with any Hong Kong law, the Beijing law takes priority. In a video address to the UN Human Rights Council on Tuesday, Chief Executive Carrie Lam said crimes under the new law would be clearly defined. She said the law would only target a ""small minority"" and would not undermine Hong Kong's autonomy, adding: ""We respect differences in opinion."" In recent years, Hong Kong has seen waves of protests demanding more rights. Last year, rallies over a now-scrapped bill permitting extraditions to the mainland turned violent and fuelled a broad pro-democracy movement.",9498
bbc_19,2020-06-30,BBC,UK,"Hong Kong security law: Minutes after new law, pro-democracy voices quit","On Tuesday morning, the news started to break from Beijing: China had passed a new security law in Hong Kong. The law criminalises any act of secession, subversion, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces. And within minutes, the effect was obvious. Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong began to quit, fearful of the new law, and the punishment it allows. Here is some of the reaction from them, other governments, and campaign groups. Secretary-general and founding member of pro-democracy group Demosisto, and key figure in 2014 Umbrella movement ""It [the law] marks the end of Hong Kong that the world knew before,"" said Mr Wong, after announcing he was quitting Demosisto. ""From now on, Hong Kong enters a new era of reign of terror, just like Taiwan's White Terror, with arbitrary prosecutions, black jails, secret trials, forced confessions, media clampdowns and political censorship. ""With sweeping powers and ill-defined law, the city will turn into a secret police state. Hong Kong protesters now face high possibilities of being extradited to China's courts for trials and life sentences."" Founding chairman of Demosisto, former student leader On Facebook, Mr Law said the law marked the start of a ""bloody cultural revolution"". But, despite quitting Demosisto, he said he would continue to fight for democracy ""in a personal capacity"". He added on Twitter: ""Stay strong, my friends. Hong Kong people will not give up."" Hours after Mr Law, Mr Wong, and others quit Demosisto, the group announced it would disband entirely. ""We will meet again,"" it said. Pro-independence group Minutes after the law was passed, the group said on Twitter it was disbanding in Hong Kong, but would continue its work overseas. It reportedly has branches in Taiwan and the UK. Its Hong Kong spokesman, Baggio Leung - who was briefly a member of parliament in 2016 - is also leaving the group. But the group said the end of operations in Hong Kong did not mean its fight was over. ""Today is not the end point,"" it said. ""From now on, China will have the power to impose its own laws on any criminal suspect it chooses,"" said the head of Amnesty's China team, Joshua Rosenzweig. ""The fact that the Chinese authorities have now passed this law without the people of Hong Kong being able to see it tells you a lot about their intentions. ""Their aim is to govern Hong Kong through fear from this point forward."" ""The move severely impacts Hong Kong society's freedom, human rights and stability,"" said cabinet spokesman Evian Ting, as the Taiwanese government warned its citizens of an increased risk in visiting Hong Kong. ""The government strongly condemns it and reiterates its support for the people of Hong Kong as they strive for democracy and freedom."" Hong Kong government leader, speaking before the law was passed ""There is no need for us to worry,"" Ms Lam said in May. ""In the last 23 years, whenever people worried about Hong Kong's freedom of speech and freedom of expression and protest, time and again, Hong Kong has proven that we uphold and preserve those values.""

bbc_20,2020-07-08,BBC,UK,Hong Kong security law: Beijing security office opens in Hong Kong,"A new national security office has been officially opened in Hong Kong, placing mainland Chinese agents in the heart of the territory for the first time. The office is one element of a sweeping new law which outlaws criticism of China's government. Hong Kong was, until the law was passed, the only part of China not subject to such policies. The law has caused alarm in Hong Kong but officials say it will restore stability after violent protests. Chief Executive Carrie Lam said on Tuesday that it was ""actually relatively mild as far as national security laws are concerned"" and would enable Hong Kongers to ""exercise their rights and freedoms without being intimidated and attacked"". The temporary base of the new office is a hotel in Causeway Bay, the commercial district next to Victoria Park, which had long been the focal point of pro-democracy protest marches and rallies in Hong Kong. An opening ceremony was held on Wednesday morning, attended by dignitaries including Chief Executive Carrie Lam and Zheng Yanxiong, the hardliner chosen by Beijing to head up the new office. The Chinese flag was raised outside the office, amid heavy security including a bomb disposal unit. Luo Huining, head of the existing Hong Kong-Beijing liaison office, said the office would be ""the envoy for Hong Kong's safety and is also the gatekeeper of national security"". Security agents from the mainland who are based in the new office will, for the first time, have the power to investigate people for a wide range of crimes defined by the new law, and potentially extradite them to the mainland for trial. Chinese courts, which are controlled by the Communist Party, have a close to 100% conviction rate. The legislation is the most sweeping change to the political landscape of Hong Kong since it was handed back to China by the UK in 1997. It has been heavily criticised globally for undermining freedoms guaranteed under the ""one country, two systems"" agreed as part of the handover, which gave the territory a lot of control over how it ran itself. Several prominent figures from the anti-Beijing protest movement have left Hong Kong or closed their social media accounts in the wake of the law. Several social media companies have said they will stop co-operating with the Hong Kong police on requests for user data over concerns about how it will be used, while  TikTok has said it is pulling out of Hong Kong entirely.",8028
bbc_21,2020-07-05,BBC,UK,Hong Kong security law: Pro-democracy books pulled from libraries,"Books by pro-democracy figures have been removed from public libraries in Hong Kong in the wake of a controversial new security law. The works will be reviewed to see if they violate the new law, the authority which runs the libraries said. The legislation targets secession, subversion and terrorism with punishments of up to life in prison. Opponents say it erodes the territory's freedoms as a semi-autonomous region of China. Beijing rejects this. Hong Kong's sovereignty was handed back to China by Britain in 1997 and certain rights were supposed to be guaranteed for at least 50 years under the ""one country, two systems"" agreement. Since the security law came into effect on Tuesday, several leading pro-democracy activists have stepped down from their roles. One of them - one-time student leader and local legislator Nathan Law - has fled the territory. At least nine books have become unavailable or marked as ""under review"", according to the South China Morning Post newspaper. They include books authored or co-authored by Joshua Wong, a prominent pro-democracy activist, and pro-democracy politician Tanya Chan. On Saturday, Mr Wong tweeted that the new law ""imposes a mainland-style censorship regime"" on Hong Kong, calling it ""one step away from ... actual book banning"". The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter Beijing has dismissed criticism of the law, saying it is necessary to stop the type of mass pro-democracy protests seen in Hong Kong during much of 2019, which at times exploded into very violent clashes between protesters and police. Why people are scared of Hong Kong's new lawMinutes after new law, voices quit It has rejected complaints by the UK and other Western nations that it is in breach of guarantees it made to protect Hong Kong's unique freedoms as interference in its internal affairs. By Danny Vincent, BBC News, Hong Kong Hong Kong was promised certain political freedoms for 50 years after the handover. It was guaranteed rights such as freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and an independent judicial system. To many Hong Kong residents, the national security law represents a premature end to those freedoms. Supporters say the law will help to restore order after a year of protest. But critics say it is being used to criminalise opposition to Beijing. The removal of political books from public libraries would have been unimaginable just a week ago. In today's Hong Kong, business owners remove messages of support for the protest movement from their premises, fearful that they could be interpreted as attempts at inciting subversion. So far, 10 people have been arrested for allegedly violating the new law. But fear and uncertainty are widespread. Protesters now call for demonstrators to hold up blank placards at marches. They fear that their words could lead to life imprisonment. The law is wide-ranging, and gives Beijing powers to shape life in Hong Kong that it has never had before. The law makes inciting hatred of China's central government and Hong Kong's regional government offences. It also allows for closed-door trials, wire-tapping of suspects and the potential for suspects to be tried on the Chinese mainland. Acts including damaging public transport facilities - which often happened during the 2019 protests - can be considered terrorism. There are also concerns over online freedom as internet providers might have to hand over data if requested by police.",4315
bbc_22,2020-06-30,BBC,UK,Hong Kong security law: Life sentences for breaking China-imposed law,"People in Hong Kong could face life in jail for breaking a controversial and sweeping new security law imposed by China. The legislation came into force on Tuesday but the full text was only revealed hours afterwards. It was brought in by Beijing following increasing unrest and a widening pro-democracy movement. Critics say the new law effectively curtails protest and undermines Hong Kong's freedoms. The territory was handed back to China from British control in 1997, but under a unique agreement supposed to protect certain freedoms that people in mainland China do not enjoy - including freedom of speech. Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, defended the law, saying it filled a ""gaping hole"" in national security. Details have been closely guarded and the Beijing-backed politician admitted she had not seen the draft before commenting. Why are there protests in Hong Kong? All the context you needDo protests ever work in China? But Ted Hui, an opposition legislator, told the BBC: ""Our rights are (being) taken away; our freedom is gone; our rule of law, our judicial independence is gone."" The UK, EU and Nato have all expressed concern and anger, while pro-democracy groups have started to disband amid fears of immediate reprisals. Washington, which also urged Beijing to reconsider, had already begun to end the preferential treatment Hong Kong enjoys in trade and travel with the US, bringing it in line with mainland China. Full details of the new law only emerged after it had come into effect at about 23:00 local time on Tuesday (16:00 BST). It applies to both permanent and non-permanent residents. Among the details: Crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces are punishable by a minimum sentence of three years, with the maximum being life Inciting hatred of China's central government and Hong Kong's regional government are now offences under Article 29Damaging public transport facilities can be considered terrorism - protesters often targeted city infrastructure during the long-running demonstrations Those found guilty will not be allowed to stand for public officeBeijing will establish a new security office in Hong Kong, with its own law enforcement personnel - neither of which would come under the local authority's jurisdictionHong Kong's chief executive can appoint judges in national security cases, and the justice secretary can decide whether or not there is a juryDecisions made by the national security commission, set up by local authorities, cannot be challenged legallyChina also says it will take over prosecution in cases which are considered ""very serious"", while some trials will be heard behind closed doors.Management of foreign non-governmental organisations and news agencies will be strengthenedThe law can also apparently be broken from abroad by non-residents, under Article 38 The law will not apply to acts which happened before it came into force. Under the national security law, many of the acts of protest that have rocked Hong Kong over the past year could now be classed as subversion or secession… and punished with up to life in prison. The city's pro-Beijing leader, Carrie Lam, said the law was long overdue. Fearing repercussions, political activists are resigning their posts and one pro-democracy protester, who asked to remain anonymous, told me that ordinary people are now deleting posts on social media. Many people are just stopping talking about politics, and stopping talking about freedom and democracy because they want to save their own lives. They want to save their freedom and avoid being arrested. One contact of mine, a lawyer and human rights activist, sent me a message shortly after the law was passed. Please delete everything on this chat, he wrote. The reaction began the moment the law - which was first announced six weeks ago - was signed by China's President Xi Jinping. Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong began to quit immediately, fearful of the new law, and the punishment it allows. According to the South China Morning Post, pro-democracy businesses began clearing away any sign they had once supported the protests. Joshua Wong, secretary-general and founding member of pro-democracy group Demosisto, warned the city would ""turn into a secret police state"". ""Beijing's promise to the world that Hong Kong will have a high degree of autonomy is proven to be a lie,"" opposition legislator Ted Hui told the BBC's Newshour programme. But despite the risks, some remained determined to go ahead with the banned traditional 1 July rally planned for Wednesday, amid reports of large numbers of police descending onto Hong Kong's financial district. Read more: Minutes after new law, pro-democracy voices quit The move also provoked international reaction, with the UK's Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, saying China had broken the promises it had made to the people of Hong Kong under the terms of the 1997 handover. He added that the government ""fully"" intends to see through plans to change visa rules, offering millions of people in Hong Kong a way to acquire UK citizenship. That agreement enshrined the ""one country, two systems"" principle in a document called the Basic Law - Hong Kong's mini constitution - for 50 years. The Basic Law protects rights such as freedom of assembly and freedom of speech - neither of which exist in mainland China - and also sets out the structure of governance for the territory. Julian Braithwaite, Britain's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, told the UN Human Rights Council that the law ""has clear implications for human rights"". Mr Braithwaite, speaking on behalf of 27 nations, urged China to reconsider.",6367
theDiplomat_23,2020-07-01,the Diplomat,US,Hong Kong Through Water and Fire,"Credit: AP Photo/Kin CheungAdvertisementIt has been a year since the beginning of the anti-extradition law movement, and it seems safe to say that Hong Kong will never be the same. The movement began as a massive pushback across Hong Kong society to resist the government’s proposed bill allowing extradition to mainland China and more generally the growing erosion of Hong Kong’s constitutionally guaranteed “high degree of autonomy.” It therefore began as a “reactive” (in the framework of Charles Tilly) movement, whereas the 2014 Umbrella Movement was arguably more “proactive” in trying to advance a deeper form of democratization.After the unprecedented 1- and 2-million strong peaceful marches that took place on June 9 and June 16, respectively, millions of people mobilized over the course of six months, punctuated by hundreds of marches and gatherings, as well as a number of violent confrontations. At the same time, the movement morphed into a massive if inchoate attempt to resist the “restructuring” of Hong Kong’s basic institutions by Beijing. The government’s unwillingness to make concessions or engage in dialogue fueled a spiral of mutual escalation, in which outraged protesters, whose main claims were supported for most of the period by around 80 percent of Hong Kongers, faced off with a police force that was left alone to deal with political issues that it was not equipped to address and that the government refused to confront. Although withdrawal of the bill was officially announced on September 4 and completed on October 23, the confrontation continued unabated, with growing involvement from the Central Government, further complicating any resolution. Finally, the District Council elections in late November brought an overwhelming though arguably symbolic victory to the pro-democracy camp, allowing for a tentative though fragile, and ultimately short-lived, de-escalation.While the protesters were initially successful in adopting the new tactic to “be water,” in which direct confrontation could be avoided and the movement remained versatile and leaderless, as the summer went on, the call to “burn together” (laamchau) became more dominant. In the course of the movement, over 7,000 people were arrested, over 2,000 were injured, more than 1,300 complaints were filed against the police. Social trust in virtually all of Hong Kong’s institutions was deeply shaken, if not entirely destroyed.Although the extradition bill was withdrawn, the central government in Beijing has now further raised the stakes by imposing national security legislation that threatens to imperil Hong Kong’s basic freedoms more than any decision since the handover. While it is as yet unclear how the law will be applied, its 66 articles contain many causes for concern. Given the severity of the implications, it is perhaps worth pausing to look back at the claims and attempt to untangle the escalating dynamics of the movement in order to understand more clearly where Hong Kong stands today.When 1 million people took to the streets peacefully on June 9, 2019, the target was undoubtedly the unpopular extradition bill, but also more broadly the accumulating encroachments on Hong Kong’s autonomy, which had accelerated since 2015. The erosion of Hong Kong autonomy came in more and more rapid succession: booksellers and a Chinese tycoon disappeared over the border to mainland China, elected lawmakers were disqualified from office by virtue of a Basic Law interpretation that came in the midst of ongoing legal proceedings in Hong Kong, nonviolent participants in the Umbrella Movement were aggressively prosecuted, noncustodial sentences were systematically appealed by the prosecution, and a respected foreign journalist was denied a visa after chairing a panel discussion with a fringe pro-independence activist. Under the doctrine of “comprehensive jurisdiction” laid down in 2014, many observers believed that the central government was playing an increasingly active role in directing at least three branches of Hong Kong’s administration: prosecution, immigration, and law enforcement.Enjoying this article?

Just $5 a month.It has been pointed out many times that despite the massive turnout in the peaceful marches, it was the smaller violent protest of June 12, 2019, met with violence in return by the police side, that led to suspending the bill on June 15. The break-in into the Legislative Council on July 1 can be seen as the defining moment for the first phase of the movement. Not only were the protesters’ five demands (withdrawing the law rather than simply suspending it, releasing arrested protesters, removing the “rioter” accusation, establishing an independent commission of inquiry on police violence, and advancing universal suffrage) formally read out in the chamber, but the solidarity among the protesters was movingly demonstrated when the few remaining “occupiers” inside the chamber were carried out by their comrades shortly before the police arrived in order to “leave no one behind.” The leaderless, versatile, creative movement, organized spontaneously through flashmobs and telegram channels, using Lennon Walls as its main means of expression and communication with the public, enjoyed overwhelming support among the population. It was characterized by its display of solidarity between peaceful and forceful protesters (“brothers climbing the mountain together; don’t snitch and don’t split”). The demands, even universal suffrage, seemed within the scope of the Basic Law, and although most people did not expect the government to give in, in early July the movement was broadly understood to have secured additional breathing space. Former Chief Justice Andrew Li published an op-ed on July 9 calling for an independent Commission of Inquiry, widely viewed as an acceptably compromise for all sides, supported across the political spectrum (support grew steadily from around 75 percent in June to 87 percent in October).However, the government remained inflexible on the five demands, and events took a turn toward mutual escalation. After the violent beatings of protesters by “white shirts” in Yuen Long on July 21, the police force, already accused of unwarranted violence, was widely suspected of collusion with organized crime and suffered an unprecedented collapse in citizen confidence. The outrage was shared far beyond the ranks of the protesters; it confirmed the widespread feeling that the foundations of Hong Kong had been sapped and the entire civil contract needed to be reestablished. This was the context in which the slogan “Reclaim Hong Kong, Revolution of the Times” became ubiquitous. It referred not so much to independence as to a sense of a newfound community, in which solidarity was not simply a strategy but became the dominant ideology of the movement. Yet the “incipient community” was defined in vague, somewhat romantic terms as a brother- and sisterhood, a pre-political community bound together by trauma and pain, as well as by a stark sense of right and wrong (as expressed also in the “anthem” of the movement, “Glory to Hong Kong”). This was a community ready to fight until the end, but without politically articulated goals beyond the five demands.Diplomat BriefWeekly NewsletterNGet briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.Get the Newsletter   At the same time, July 21 marked the targeting by protesters of the Central Government Liaison Office and the defacing of the national emblem, which triggered the direct implication of the central government in Beijing. While we have no way of gauging the degree of control exerted by the center, in June and early July, Beijing officials seemed eager to let Carrie Lam take the blame and handle the protests. By contrast, the deluge of official pronouncements from Beijing beginning on July 22 leaves little doubt that the Hong Kong government was decisively marginalized from that date. A formulation referring to “three bottom lines” (endangering national security or sovereignty, challenging the central government or the Basic Law, using Hong Kong as a base for undermining the mainland regime) appeared after the July Politburo meeting. On August 5, the day of the first general strike in Hong Kong since 1925, a first-page People’s Daily editorial laid out further red lines, which aimed to cow the divided pro-Beijing forces into submission: pro-establishment politicians were summoned to “take a stance,” businesses like Cathay Pacific and MTR Corporation were ordered to discipline their employees or face lockout from the China market. The full force of law enforcement, including police and prosecution (through accelerated procedures), would be used to crack down on the protests. Civil servants, schools, and universities were ordered to fall into rank. This approach, endlessly repeated and copy-pasted in official texts, was eventually enshrined in the text of the Fourth Plenum of the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) 19th Central Committee in early November, foreshadowing the 2020 national security law.AdvertisementThe spiral of escalation was also fueled by the protesters, whose growing sense of desperation was expressed in the notion of laamchau or “burning together.” The participative tactics debated on Telegram did not always yield ideal outcomes, and protesters who opposed “renovating” (i.e. vandalizing) pro-establishment shops were often overruled, despite Edward Leung’s call from prison to refrain from violence. From August 5, authorizations for protest gatherings were increasingly withheld by the police, making the gatherings de facto illegal; when they were allowed, authorization was sometimes withdrawn abruptly in the midst of the protest, and the police employed more and more forceful tactics. The government strategy could be described as a deliberate criminalization of protest. After the dramatic events of August 31, when apparently peaceful protesters were beaten by police in the MTR at Prince Edward Station, the MTR network was increasingly targeted, as another one of the city’s beloved and respected institutions was suspected of having gone over to the dark side. Police again resisted an independent investigation and the MTR withheld video surveillance footage. Violent clashes culminated in November, with the government’s attempt to impose a mask ban through the Emergency Regulations Ordinance (overruled by the Court of Appeals, despite grumbling in Beijing), and the occupation of university campuses, most dramatically Chinese University and Polytechnic University (where over 1,000 arrests took place), in an attempt to block key adjacent roads (Tolo Highway at Chinese U and the Cross-Harbor Tunnel entrance at Poly U). A man was set on fire by protesters and another died after being hit by a brick.Police violence has been documented in great detail, by journalists, NGOs (such as Amnesty International and Citizen Report), as well as through in-depth interviews with critical members of the police force and analysis by specialized academics. The Washington Post investigated 65 events of alleged police violence and found that guidelines for use of force were routinely ignored, and even officially loosened during the protests. In particular, the threshold for the use of lethal force (19 live rounds were fired during the movement) was lowered ahead of China’s National Day on October 1 (this was also confirmed by South China Morning Post and Mingpao). The police force was pervaded by a culture of impunity epitomized in its internal watchdog, the IPCC, widely seen as toothless. A group of foreign experts hired by the IPCC as consultants collectively resigned to protest against their lack of resources and regulatory powers. Nonetheless, not a single police officer was sanctioned (not even one who drove a motorcycle into a group of protesters), and several incidents suggested that the Hong Kong government itself was unable to control the police force, which seemed to have opened direct lines of communication with Beijing. This situation of deadlock destroyed social trust in Hong Kong institutions. Trust in the police force plummeted to levels never previously observed: 51 percent of respondents rated their trust in the police at 0 out of 10 in early October (up from just 6.5 percent in early June), and the average level was 2.6 out of 10. Various index measures all reached historical depths in October: confidence in the SAR government (2.32 out of 10), in the central government (2.79), in “one country, two systems” (3.19). Separate polls indicated the popularity of the chief executive also fell to unplumbed depths at 11 percent in late October.Nonetheless, as shown by detailed surveys of protesters’ claims, published research based on the surveys, as well as a database of posters and slogans, the protesters’ claims remained largely within the scope of the five demands. A survey conducted in October showed low support for the idea of independence (11 percent), a finding consistent with previous surveys (although the government’s approach to denying peaceful advocates of self-determination or independence the right to run for office is widely rejected and may be seen as one of the underlying causes of the movement). Nonetheless, the twice-yearly survey of Hong Kongers’ self-identification carried out in early December 2019 showed an unprecedented level of exclusive identification as “Hong Kongers” (55.4 percent of overall respondents and 81.8 percent of 18-29-year-olds), whereas 32.3 percent declared a mixed identity and 10.9 percent identified as Chinese. The movement did not advocate independence or self-determination, but the degree of solidarity it displayed undoubtedly strengthened the feeling of belonging to a community of shared values.Because of the relative moderation of the demands (despite the controversy over violent methods), the District Council election in late November offered a possible route toward de-escalation. Many candidates ran on a “five-demands-not-one-less” platform, and the outcome was an overwhelming victory for the pro-democracy forces. With an unprecedented turnout (71 percent) and 57 percent of the votes, the pro-democrats took over 80 percent of seats and control 17 out of 18 district boards. This result seemed to pave the way for an institutionalization of the movement through electoral politics, neighborhood work funded by the District Councils, the many new pro-democracy trade unions that blossomed in the wake of the movement, and the “yellow economic circle” (patronizing pro-democracy businesses), which represented a downscaling from the “redecoration” strategy earlier in the year. The “burn together” theory received an optimistic footnote: Hong Kong could be a “phoenix,” reborn from its ashes. This optimistic view was endorsed by various movement intellectuals. Benny Tai suggested that the September 2020 Legislative Council election offered an opportunity for the democracy movement to win a majority and block the budget vote, eventually forcing Chief Executive Carrie Lam to resign and leading to a full-fledged bonfire of vanities. At the very least, a majority in LegCo might allow the pan-democrats to establish an independent Commission of Inquiry on police violence.The political reality, however, was that the Hong Kong and Beijing governments fully intended to continue escalating their response to the protests. Beijing’s assertion in May 2020 that its interventions in Hong Kong governance are no longer limited by Article 22 of the Basic Law, and most importantly its decision to legislate directly on national security using Annex III of the Basic Law, suggests that Hong Kong will enter a period of political rectification. “Burning together” has turned out to be a two-edged sword, as Beijing, too, seems willing to accept the loss or significant reduction of Hong Kong’s role as an international financial and business center. What began as a watery, versatile though determined movement of mass resistance was caught up in the flames of power politics.Hong Kong’s national security law not only criminalizes as “sedition,” “terrorism” or “collusion” many forms of protest or political activism that were previously understood to be acceptable. By establishing a national security commissioner in Hong Kong whose office will not be under Hong Kong’s jurisdiction, by creating a parallel system of prosecution and trial, and by removing the barrier between the Hong Kong and mainland legal systems, the new law essentially represents a full-fledged “restructuring” of the “one country two systems” arrangement.Analogies have been drawn with Berlin in 1961 and Prague in 1968, but the most persuasive comparison may be with the events of February 28, 1947 in Taiwan. There too, in a territory recently returned from colonial rule to central Chinese administration, a chance event triggered a massive movement of resistance against the reorganization of the island, only to be met with overwhelming force by the new colonizer and ultimately a campaign of White Terror that lasted for several decades, before a democratic opposition was able to rebuild momentum in the late 1970s.Enjoying this article?

Hong Kong citizens celebrate the passage of the Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) in Causeway Bay of south China's Hong Kong, June 30, 2020. The law was passed at the 20th session of the Standing Committee of the 13th National People's Congress (NPC). (Xinhua/Wang Shen)

	Listed by the NPC Standing Committee in Annex III to the HKSAR Basic Law, the national security legislation is expected to terminate the region’s long-standing “unguarded” condition in national security after being applied in the HKSAR.

	Since the disturbance related to the now-withdrawn ordinance amendments concerning the transfer of fugitives in the HKSAR in June 2019, “Hong Kong independence” forces, radical separatist forces, and the opposition in the region have grossly trampled on the rule of law and social stability of Hong Kong, inflicted heavy losses on its economy, damaged its business environment and international image, and undermined foreign investors’ confidence in the HKSAR.

	With international agencies constantly downgrading Hong Kong’s credit rating because of its social unrest, the region lost its title as the world’s freest economy, which it had maintained for 25 consecutive years. Besides, the city’s ranking among global financial centers has also dropped to the sixth.

	The region logged an 8.9-percent year-on-year slump in its GDP in the first quarter of the year, representing the sharpest quarterly decline on record.

	In addition, the HKSAR’s unemployment rate rocketed to 5.9 percent in the period from March to May, a record high in 15 years. It is the reality Hong Kong faces.

	Safeguarding national security is the foundation and a prerequisite for Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability.

	The rapidly evolving situation in the region during the past more than a year has fully demonstrated that prosperity and stability is totally out of the question without the guarantee of national security.

	It must be understood clearly that legal loopholes regarding national security have cost Hong Kong society dear.

	Because of the lack of national security legislation, Hong Kong has witnessed in pain how the “Hong Kong independence” forces, black-clad rioters, and home-grown terrorists who threatened “mutual destruction” have kept escalating their violent activities at various locations, and secessionist, subversive, collusive, and disruptive practices have been conducted so unrestrainedly.

	The efforts of China’s central government to plug the loopholes in safeguarding national security in Hong Kong, stop violence and curb disorder with effective measures, and restore the region’s sound legal and business environment are not only in line with the common interests of all sectors of Hong Kong society as well as foreign investors in the region, but also important guarantee of Hong Kong’s status as a global financial, trade, and shipping center.

	Only with a solid foundation for national security and overall social stability can a country create better environment and greater room to address deep-seated problems and issues troubling economy and people’s livelihood.

	When Hong Kong was confronted with severe challenges in safeguarding national security and was unable to complete relevant legislation on its own, the central government took decisive measures to establish and improve the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security in Hong Kong from the state level.

	The endeavor has been not only absolutely imperative for the prevention and control of national security risks, but also the fundamental solution to problems undermining the long-term prosperity, peace, and order of Hong Kong.

	Hong Kong could never return to the right track and restore order if its legal loopholes in safeguarding national security remained, weak links in the system not improved, and the main dangers obstructing its long-term prosperity and stability not eliminated.

	It can be predicted that with the introduction of the new national security law, which defines a clear bottom line of national security and explicit standards of right and wrong, Hong Kong will see less confrontations and internal friction stirred up by people with ulterior motives, so that the whole society can focus efforts on development in an easier manner.

	The introduction of the national security law brings Hong Kong citizens the freedom of enjoying a peaceful life without concerns about the threat of black-clad rioters, the freedom of safe business operation, and the freedom of safe trips to office and school.

	By guaranteeing a stable environment, putting an end to the social unrest, boosting market confidence, bringing the city into the right track, and setting a bottom line of national security, the new law means to the SAR the hope of solving deep-rooted social and economic problems including the housing woes, brighter development prospects for various sectors, and greater roles of the advantages of the “one country, two systems” principle.

	Far-sighted personages in Hong Kong have pointed out since the onset of the legislative procedures for the national security law that the region is about to move from chaos to order.

	Chief Executive of HKSAR Carrie Lam has also noted that restoring order and confidence is crucial for a fresh start of Hong Kong economy.

	It’s believed that with the newly adopted national security law for Hong Kong and the firm support of the central government, the SAR will soon stop violence, end the chaos and restore order.

	With its efforts focusing on construction and development after the introduction of the new law, Hong Kong will be able to make full use of the institutional strengths of the “one country, two systems” principle, make the most of major opportunities brought along by important initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative and the development plan for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, rebuild its advantages while integrating itself into the overall development of the country, and continue to create new development legends.",6500
peoples_daily_2,2020-07-02,People's Daily,China,"Hong Kong national security law helps ensure long-term stability of ""one country, two systems""","On June 30, the Standing Committee of the 13th National People's Congress (NPC) passed the Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and adopted a decision to list the law in Annex III to the HKSAR Basic Law.

	As a major move of the central government to manage Hong Kong affairs since its return to the motherland in 1997, the law will fully and faithfully implement the principle of “one country, two systems” and the HKSAR Basic Law, help safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, maintain Hong Kong's lasting prosperity and stability, and ensure the long-term stability of ""one country, two systems"". It bears both practical and historical significance.

	The practice of ""one country, two systems"" has achieved a universally recognized success in Hong Kong since its return to the motherland. However, it has also encountered new circumstances and problems.

	Especially since the disturbance related to the now-withdrawn ordinance amendments concerning the transfer of fugitives in the HKSAR last June, the ""anti-China"" forces in Hong Kong have publicly supported ""Hong Kong's independence,"" ""self-determination"" and ""referendum"" and engaged in activities to undermine the national unity and separate Hong Kong from China.

	Meanwhile, some foreign and external forces blatantly interfered in Hong Kong affairs, supporting and protecting the ""anti-China"" forces in Hong Kong and using Hong Kong to damage the national security of China.

	The Chinese people, including the Hong Kong compatriots, have realized more than ever that the long-term absence of a national security law in Hong Kong has plunged the special administrative region into the gravest situation since its return to the motherland and that the collusion of ""anti-China"" forces inside and outside Hong Kong has greatly hindered the long-term stability of the ""one country, two systems"" principle.

	The principle of ""one country, two systems"" was proposed to achieve and maintain national unity, while safeguarding national security is at the core of the principle.

	Enacting the law on safeguarding national security in the HKSAR based on the authorization of the NPC, the Standing Committee of the NPC aims to improve institutional mechanisms related to the implementation of the Constitution, the HKSAR Basic Law, and the NPC Decision on Establishing and Improving the Legal System and Enforcement Mechanisms for the HKSAR to Safeguard National Security under new circumstances. It will work to plug the legal loopholes, make up for the lack of relevant mechanisms and deal with shortcomings of the HKSAR in safeguarding national security. Besides, it will also prompt the HKSAR to fulfill its constitutional and major responsibilities to safeguard national security, make systematic and comprehensive regulation in legal system and implementation mechanism at both national and the HKSAR levels, and properly handle the docking, compatibility, and complementarity between the law on safeguarding national security in the HKSAR and relevant national and HKSAR laws.

	These efforts are made to fully and faithfully implement the principle of “one country, two systems” and make sure the principle is not distorted in practice and keeps advancing in the right direction.

	The legislation on national security is a legislative power of every sovereign state, be it unitary or federal.

	The law on safeguarding national security in the HKSAR, which has 66 articles in six chapters, is a comprehensive law that covers the contents in substantive law, procedural law and organic law.

	It clearly stipulates the duties and government bodies of the HKSAR for safeguarding national security; the four categories of offences – secession, subversion, terrorist activities, and collusion with a foreign country or external elements to endanger national security – and their corresponding penalties; jurisdiction, applicable law and procedure; office of the central government for safeguarding national security in the HKSAR; and other contents.

	The legislation thus establishes a legal system and enforcement mechanism for the HKSAR to safeguard national security.

	It not only plugs the legal loopholes of Hong Kong in protecting national security, but effectively restrains the ""anti-China"" forces in Hong Kong, thus preventing and controlling the risks in national security and consolidating the foundation of ""one country, two systems"".

	Only when the basis of ""one country"" is guaranteed can Hong Kong embrace greater benefits of ""two systems"".

	It should be noted that the newly-adopted legislation only targets a few actions and activities that seriously endanger national security, such as ""Hong Kong's independence,"" “black-clad violence,” and mobsters’ “mutual destruction.” It will not affect the capitalist system in the region or its high degree of autonomy and legal system.

	Only with national security can Hong Kong guarantee its social stability, lay the foundations for solving development problems, and effectively protect the life and property safety, rights and freedom of the Hong Kong residents. National security will also enable the HKSAR government and society to concentrate on solving the deep-seated contradictions and problems related to the economy and people's livelihood.

	In a word, ""one country, two systems"" could only be put into better practice when national security is well protected.

	The year 2020 marks the 30th anniversary of the promulgation of the HKSAR Basic Law. As a legal and institutional embodiment of the ""one country, two systems"" principle, the HKSAR Basic Law has been adopted to maintain national unity and territorial integrity and protect Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.

	The newly-passed law on safeguarding national security in the HKSAR is believed to help ensure the long-term stability of ""one country, two systems"".

	While remaining true to its original aspiration and marching forward, the central government of China has enough sincerity and confidence to ensure that the ""one country, two systems"" principle remains unchanged and is unwaveringly upheld. It also has the resolve and capability to ensure no distortion of the ""one country, two systems"" practice.",4325
peoples_daily_3,2020-07-02,People's Daily,China,Law and order dawns in Hong Kong as new law takes effect,"-- The festive mood across Hong Kong on the 23rd anniversary of its return to the motherland stood in sharp contrast to the scenes a year ago when rioters stormed the Legislative Council complex and wreaked havoc inside.

-- The newly enacted law on safeguarding national security in Hong Kong would help restore stability, said HKSAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam.

-- The promulgation of the law marks a significant turning point for Hong Kong to move from turmoil to stability, and a major milestone for the practice of ""one country, two systems,"" said Luo Huining, director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR.

-- ""If it were not for the national security legislation, I would decide to leave Hong Kong at once,"" said Angelo Giuliano, a Swiss expatriate.

	HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong reached a significant turning point on the 23rd anniversary of its return to the motherland as a law on safeguarding national security came into force.

	Celebrations were held across Hong Kong Wednesday morning. Helicopters flew the national and regional flags over Victoria Harbor, and a fireboat sprayed a water-column salute. Choruses of residents sang the national anthem at multiple landmarks.

	The festive mood stood in sharp contrast to the scenes a year ago when large groups of rioters stormed the Legislative Council complex of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and wreaked havoc inside. It was one of the most atrocious violent incidents during months of social unrest last year.

	On Tuesday, the Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the HKSAR was passed unanimously by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. It took effect at 11:00 p.m. local time the same day upon its promulgation by the HKSAR government in the Gazette.

	TURNING POINT

	At a reception held Wednesday morning, Chief Executive of the HKSAR Carrie Lam stressed the significance of the anniversary and said the new law would help restore stability in Hong Kong.

	The national security law seeks to prevent, curb and punish crimes seriously endangering national security, namely secession, subversion, terrorist activities, and collusion with a foreign country or external elements to endanger national security.

	Lam called the enactment of the law a ""turning point"" to take Hong Kong out of the current impasse and to restore stability and order from the chaos.

	The legislation follows the prolonged social disturbances that have gripped Hong Kong since June last year. Intensified violent incidents and riots trampled on order and the rule of law, threatened people's safety, and endangered national security.

	The unrest exposed the tremendous risks Hong Kong faces in safeguarding national security and posed a grave challenge to ""one country, two systems,"" Luo Huining, director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR, said Wednesday at an opening ceremony of the activities to celebrate the 23rd anniversary of Hong Kong's return.

	Echoing Lam's words, Luo said the promulgation of the law marks a significant turning point for Hong Kong to move from turmoil to stability, and a major milestone for the practice of ""one country, two systems"" in Hong Kong.

	In Victoria Harbor, 150 fishing vessels, festooned with banners and the national flag, sailed in a procession to celebrate the anniversary and the passage of the new law. Joyful Hong Kong residents warmly greeted the boats on the harbor front.

	The captain of the lead boat, surnamed Leung, has participated in every such parade since 1997. Leung, 68, said the lives of fishermen had become better and better since Hong Kong returned to the motherland. ""Only when our country is prosperous, can Hong Kong be prosperous,"" he said.

	END TO TURMOIL

	""If it were not for the national security legislation, I would decide to leave Hong Kong at once,"" Angelo Giuliano said.

	The Swiss expatriate, 50, was looking for opportunities in the financial consultancy field in Hong Kong three years ago, attracted by its stable environment and business opportunities, but found himself unexpectedly dragged into the chaos last year and faced real threats to his safety.

	When Giuliano was trying to help clear a street blocked by debris, rioters hurled stones at him and his friends. After attending assemblies to protest the violence, his private information, along with that of his family, was leaked online.

	Numerous ordinary Hong Kong residents echoed Giuliano's personal experience and feelings about the new law.

	Violence used to be a common occurrence during the social unrest. Rioters besieged government and legislative buildings, trashed metro stations, banks and shops, and assaulted innocent residents. Their actions plunged Hong Kong into chaos and a deep economic recession, and posed a significant and increasing threat to national security.

	Radicals advocating ""Hong Kong independence"" colluded with external forces and applied ""burn with us"" and terrorist-style tactics, intending to destroy Hong Kong and contain China's development, said British barrister Grenville Cross, who had worked as director of Public Prosecutions in Hong Kong for 12 years since 1997.

	Hong Kong has enjoyed a high degree of autonomy and maintained its prosperity under ""one country, two systems"" since China resumed exercising sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997.

	However, with the 2014 illegal ""Occupy Central"" movement, the 2016 Mong Kok riots and the unrest in 2019, intensified political upheaval in twine with emerging homegrown terrorism and criminal activities threatening national security cast long shadows over Hong Kong's prospects.

	Regina Ip, a Hong Kong lawmaker and member of the Executive Council, expects the new law to help Hong Kong restore peace and order, guarantee the continued success of ""one country, two systems,"" and chart the course for Hong Kong's long-term development.

	TO SUSTAIN SUCCESS

	After peace and order are restored, Hong Kong will be able to weather the external challenges and remain as an attractive destination for international investors and talents, observers said.

	""What businesses want is stability and certainty. They want to know that their business isn't going to be disrupted by social unrest,"" said Stephen Phillips, director-general of investment promotion at Invest Hong Kong of the HKSAR government, noting that businesses generally welcome and understand the need for the legislation.

	Credit rating agency S&P Global Ratings recently affirmed its AA+/A-1+ issuer credit ratings on Hong Kong and maintained the outlook as stable.

	Over the past 23 years, Hong Kong has retained its capitalist system and lifestyle and made remarkable progress under ""one country, two systems.""

	""It is 'one country, two systems' that enables Hong Kong to remain competitive and keep the position as the freest economy and an international financial hub,"" Choi Koon-shum, chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce of Hong Kong, said.

	Hong Kong's gross domestic product (GDP) doubled from 1997 to 2019 with an annual growth of 3 percent, well above the 2-percent increase of advanced economies on average, and Hong Kong's GDP per capita was higher than that of Germany, Japan and Britain.

	Backed by a fast-growing mainland economy and the firm support of the central government, Hong Kong has overcome various difficulties since 1997, from the Asian financial crisis to the SARS outbreak and the global financial crisis, said Maria Tam, deputy director of the HKSAR Basic Law Committee under the NPC Standing Committee.

	""I hope Hong Kong society can calm down at an early date so that we can shift the focus to improving people's livelihoods, bolstering growth and integrating into the national development,"" Tam said, noting new opportunities for Hong Kong businesses generated in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.

	Ilan, a diamond dealer from Israel, is eager to regain a peaceful life in Hong Kong. Born and raised in the Middle East, he has been in Hong Kong for 18 years and fathered two children.

	Thanks to the law, people will be able to return to all the things that made Hong Kong great to begin with, he said. ""I believe that Hong Kong can be even better than before. I'm not just saying that. I truly believe it has great potential. It just needs to shift back on course.""",3238

Hong Kong was an inseparable part of China, but became a British colony after the Qing dynasty ceded it to the British Empire in 1842 through the Treaty of Nanjing, ending the First Opium War.

	To commemorate its return to the motherland, Hongkongers are celebrating the historic occasion in a befitting manner today. The central government of China made the celebrations very special by passing the National Security Law for Hong Kong on June 30. Hongkongers have warmly welcomed and expressed unconditional support for the security law by singing patriotic songs and waving the national flag.

	Analysts are of the view that the law will help Hong Kong embrace a brighter future. Through enacting the long-overdue legislation, as required under Article 23 of the Basic Law, the long-awaited decolonization has finally been started in the former British colony. Though the global economic hub is an integral part of China, as a colonial legacy, Hong Kong retains its own currency, passport and immigration channels, and legal system.

	China has regained sovereignty over Hong Kong. The flag has changed, a tiny People's Liberation Army contingent has replaced its British counterpart, and the National People’s Congress has interpreted the local Basic Law a few times. But, thanks to 150 years of British colonialism, the educational and judicial systems, as well as the civil service and mass media in Hong Kong, are still dominated by those who subscribe to the viewpoints and values of the Western imperium. They never think of the welfare and development of Hongkongers, and would rather help their colonial masters perpetuate their dominance around the world.

	As a sign of respect for the autonomy guaranteed under 'one country, two systems', the central government of China has always stuck to its non-interference policy when it comes to the city’s local government work. But the local government has constantly failed to undertake any initiative to decolonize Hong Kong in the face of riots, sabotage, violence, anarchy, and vandalism caused by the agents, pawns, and proteges of the Western imperium, especially the United States (US).

	Ironically, they do everything in the name of protecting autonomy, human rights, freedoms, and democracy. These agents love to be called 'democratic forces'. These so-called democrats are always seeking excuses to wreak havoc and destabilize this global economic hub. If we look back at the past, we can see that they created anarchy and sabotage every year under the cover of democratic movements.

	The pawns of the US broke their all-time records of violence and vandalism in their opposition to the anti-extradition bill last year. The world witnessed how valuable assets were burnt, police being assaulted every day and the national emblem and flag of China being insulted. Ironically, this sabotage took place under the pretext of peaceful demonstrations.

	The violent demonstrators made it crystal clear that they did everything under the auspices of the so-called savior of democracy, the US, as they were seen carrying the US flag in different parts of the city during the demonstrations. Though the US has no right to meddle in the internal affairs of any country in the world, it has reportedly long been instigating violence brazenly in Hong Kong.

	In an act of sheer interference in the domestic affairs of a sovereign country, the US enacted the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 last November. The US Senate also passed the so-called Hong Kong Autonomy Act on June 25. The act was designed to obstruct China's national security legislation for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region by imposing sanctions.

	To my eyes, making any kind of analysis of the US legislation is unnecessary, as the wording and content of the law made it clear that the US has directly attacked the sovereign power of China by breaching all international laws, regulations, agreements, and conventions including the charter of the United Nations.

	Finally, I would like to conclude that the national security legislation will bring about a brighter future for Hongkongers, as it will effectively make the city stable and peaceful by foiling all the conspiracies and attempts to destabilize it from the US and its local proteges. Thanks to the security law, which will only target acts such as secession, subversion, terrorist activities, and collusion with a foreign country or external elements to endanger national security, and fix the loopholes in the judiciary, the world will be able to see a more prosperous Hong Kong in the coming years.

(Xinhua/Jin Liangkuai)

	BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The law on safeguarding national security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) marks a turning point and will bring the region back on track of its development, an official said Wednesday.

	The law is designed to bring tranquility to Hong Kong, Zhang Xiaoming, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, made the remarks at a press conference in Beijing.

	The law targets only a tiny group of criminals who endanger national security and will be a ""sharp sword"" hanging over their heads, Zhang said, adding that it will also serve as a deterrent to external forces who interfere in Hong Kong affairs.

	Zhang also noted that the law will fully protect the rights and freedoms enjoyed by the vast majority of Hong Kong residents, and the legitimate rights and interests of overseas investors in Hong Kong.

	It will be the bedrock underpinning the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, Zhang said.

	Chinese lawmakers on Tuesday voted to adopt the 66-article law and later passed a decision to list the law in Annex III to the HKSAR Basic Law.

	The law on safeguarding national security in HKSAR came into force in Hong Kong at 11:00 p.m. local time on Tuesday upon its promulgation by the HKSAR government in the gazette. Enditem

globaltimes_6,2021-04-19,Global Times,China,"Biased tone, misinformation ‘major mistakes’ by BBC on HK riot: Chinese scholar","Victor Gao (center), chair professor of Soochow University and vice president of the Center for China and Globalization, was invited to the BBC's Newsnight to debate Hong Kong secessionist Nathan Law (left) on Saturday. Screenshot from BBC News YouTube channel.There were some major mistakes that the BBC made in its latest TV program Newsnight, including a biased tone and misinformation on the illegal protests led by radical anti-government figures who were wrongfully deemed ""pro-democracy activists,"" a Chinese scholar who recently engaged in an online debate with Hong Kong secessionist Nathan Law told the Global Times. Victor Gao, chair professor of Soochow University and vice president of the Center for China and Globalization, was invited to BBC's Newsnight to debate with Law, after other opposition figures such as Martin Lee Chu-ming and secessionists like Jimmy Lai Chee-ying were sentenced, which the BBC host described as 60- and- 70-something men being thrown into jail for participating in ""peaceful"" protests. When the host emphasized they were ""peaceful protests,"" the BBC got it wrong, Gao noted. ""I understand that foreign media outlets uphold their own values, for example, by claiming that the street protests are a way of exercising democratic rights. But if they still say so after the Capitol Hill riot, it's completely wrong because the nature of rioting in Hong Kong and of storming the Capitol Hill are the same,"" the Chinese scholar said. As translator for former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, Gao is fluent in English. He laid out a number of reasons why the Western media and politicians should stop calling rioters like Law ""pro-democracy activists,"" why the detention of people like Lai and Lee is in line with the local law in Hong Kong, and what is the truth about the anti-government protests in Hong Kong. It was easy to see who gained the upper hand during the debate, as compared with Law - who repeatedly emphasized ""peaceful protests"" - Gao urged both the host and Law to open their eyes and look back at the footage the BBC shot during the citywide rampage and riots in Hong Kong in 2019. ""There was violence everywhere in the streets of Hong Kong, there was a storming of the LegCo building, there was disruption of social order in Hong Kong. If you call that peaceful demonstrations, you are losing your mind, "" Gao said during the BBC show. The Chinese scholar said he also had some messages for absconding Hong Kong secessionists like Law, but he did not have enough time to elaborate on them during the show. ""I want to tell Law that he is now living in the UK, and he should not copy what he did in Hong Kong there, as he will be put into jail if he does the same thing there,"" Gao told the Global Times. While Law appeared to have no other words except ""peaceful protests"" in rebuking Gao's claims during the show, he said in a tweet on Sunday that the Chinese scholar ""was enraged when he realized his smearing attack did not work,"" and he further considered it as ""civility vs barbarity."" However, many netizens saw the embarrassment of Law when Gao called him what he really is - a fugitive who broke the law in Hong Kong. A society ruled by law will hold lawbreakers accountable, which is also the principle applied in the UK, which explained why Gao wants to suggest that Law not engage in the same so-called ""peaceful"" protests in that country, when violent illegal assembly would always face legal consequences. There's another major mistake the BBC made in its program by confusing different ideas, the Chinese scholar further elaborated. For example, broadcasting an interview with Lai, who claimed that under the national security law for Hong Kong, the Chinese government has been causing more ""fear"" and depriving him of his basic rights, which is another false statement, Gao said. ""Lai was recently sentenced for violating the public order ordinance in Hong Kong by taking part in illegal assemblies, which has nothing to do with the national security law for Hong Kong. The BBC got the facts wrong and spread this misinformation to the mainstream public,"" he said. Driven by political motivation amid a deteriorating UK-China relationship, the BBC has become more biased toward China in recent years. Still, the Chinese scholar is willing to take part in such an open debate as it's important to make the public hear the other side of the story when Western understanding about the Hong Kong riots was shaped by radical anti-government rioters. ""Also, I hope the BBC could 'wake up' one day to begin adhering to its journalistic standards [on China-related reporting], instead of serving only as a government tool in containing China,"" he said.",3711

Photo: cnsphotoThe UK, a country with massive untold interests in Hong Kong and wants to retain its colonial influence in the city as much as possible, is now acting tough against China's national security law for its Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). Chinese analysts said on Monday that the actions of the UK are more of a bluff since they can't harm China, but will only damage itself.The measures that the UK would take, including phasing out the use of Chinese firm's technology in its 5G network and offering up to 3 million Hong Kong residents the chance to settle in UK, will cost a huge amount of money and resources for the UK, rather than harm China, experts said.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson declared on Wednesday that China's new national security law in Hong Kong was a ""clear and serious breach"" of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration. It was among the strongest statements he's made as UK prime minister on the matter, Bloomberg reported.Chinese Ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaoming said Monday at a press conference that China's national security legislation for the HKSAR has ensured Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy, and does not affect the capitalist system and judicial independence in Hong Kong.The law on safeguarding national security in HKSAR was enacted to safeguard the 'one country, two systems', Liu noted, adding that the law is fundamental to end chaos and restore order in Hong Kong.Liu responded to the UK's accusation that China broke its promise in the Sino-British Joint Declaration that, ""the copyright of 'one country, two systems' belongs to Chinese former leader Deng Xiaoping, not the Sino-British Joint Declaration,"" and China has never failed to fulfill its international obligations.Cui Hongjian, the director of the Department of European Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Monday that the declaration is just a historical document that reflects the consensus of the two countries on Hong Kong at that time, and the Basic Law and the ""one country, two systems"" are China's domestic affairs rather than a promise to any other country.While the UK believes it has right and responsibility to ""ensure"" Hong Kong's autonomy, with other Western countries having similar opinions, the new national security law proves that their moves and words are useless and meaningless, Cui said.Observers noted that the UK has no power and right to comment or act on Hong Kong, and what it really cares is neither ""democracy"" nor ""human rights,"" but its untold interests in HK autonomy. An expert on international intelligence and security who asked not to be named told the Global Times that ""Hong Kong is an important financial hub and intelligence exchange center, and the UK has tried very hard to retain its inappropriate influence in its former colony, such as keeping engagements with Hong Kong politicians, funding and training proxies to influence the education sectors, as well as building connections with legal professionals.""""The UK, as a crucial member of the Five Eyes Alliance, has used its influence in Hong Kong to collect intelligence about China and influence the city's politics to favor the West after 1997. But given excessive provocation against China led by the US since last year, China has decided not to tolerate their inappropriate influence anymore. So the Johnson administration will definitely feel the pain and will act echoing angry conservative politicians in Britain,"" he said.

The US has at least 20 laws on national security while the UK has at least 3. Why can't China have one to safeguard national security on its own territory? Illustration: GT 'Do me a favor' In response to China's national security law for Hong Kong, London has announced to offer about 350,000 BNO passport holders in Hong Kong, and 2.6 million others eligible, to come to the UK for five years. A year after that, they will be able to apply for citizenship, BBC reported.BNO Passport holders in Hong Kong were granted special status in the 1980s, but have limited rights, and are only entitled to visa-free access to the UK for six months. Under the UK government's new plans, all BNOs and their dependents will be given the right to remain in the UK, including the right to work and study, for five years. At this point, they will be able to apply for settled status, and after a further year, seek citizenship.Cui said this is more like a symbolic announcement, as most young protesters or rioters convicted during the turmoil are not eligible, unless London makes new policies to accept these protesters.On the BNO policy for Hong Kong made by the UK government, Liu said it is a ""gross interference"" in the internal affairs of China and violation of international norms.China will respond to Britain's offer of citizenship to BNO passport holders in Hong Kong once it sees details of the plan, Liu said.""We hope that they will reconsider their position. With regard to China's response, we have to wait and see the specific actions of the UK,"" Liu noted.The anonymous expert noted that if these people leave Hong Kong, they can no longer make trouble in the city for their foreign masters. We won't let the criminals escape, but for ordinary people who love the UK more than China, London can do us a favor and send chartered airplanes to take them away."" ""But these people could become a problem and create economic pressure for the UK, as most of them are neither wealthy nor talented, but a bunch of law breakers, and British people who don't welcome immigrants will be very hostile to them,"" he added.

The company was excluded from providing ""core"" 5G gear, despite pressure from the US to crack down on the Chinese firm.Analysts said the British government may ""say one thing but do another,"" as the Johnson administration prioritizes economic interests over political power games.Bluff or bite?Huawei said in a statement it sent to the Global Times on Monday that it ""remains open to discussions with the government,"" and is ""finding ways with customers to manage the proposed US restrictions so the UK can maintain its lead in 5G."" ""All our world-leading products and solutions use technology and components over which the UK government has strict oversight. Our technology is already extensively used in 5G networks across the country, and has helped connect people throughout the lockdown,"" Victor Zhang, Huawei's vice president, said in the statement.The UK is actually aware that it's not a smart move to reverse its policy on Huawei, as the nation can't afford the consequences--from the industrial impact which could cost millions of dollars, to the harm done to China-UK ties, said Ma Jihua, a veteran industry analyst and close follower of Huawei.In late June, just days before the passage of the National Security Law for Hong Kong by Standing Committee of China's NPC - something markets widely anticipated - the UK government approved Huawei's plan to build a one billion pound ($1.24 billion) chip research and manufacturing facility in England.Ma added that China and Europe have long been conducting close cooperation in telecommunications so the two could establish their place in the industry, and the UK and other European countries should think twice before choosing to give up Europe's 5G lead due to US disruption.Cui noted that, fortunately, the UK is not an EU member anymore, so even if it totally excludes Huawei in its national 5G network construction, it won't affect Huawei's cooperation with Europe, which is a much bigger cake than Britain.

Photo: cnsphotoThe Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) passed the National Security Law for Hong Kong on Tuesday. The law took effect at 11 pm on Tuesday. The full text of the law shows that the law's goal is in line with national security laws across the world. There is nothing in it that suppresses democracy and freedom in Hong Kong. The four categories of crimes the law strikes have nothing to do with freedom of speech, assembly and association. Claims that the law was enacted to strengthen control on Hong Kong society are either prejudiced interpretations or ill-intentioned propaganda. Hong Kong needs a law to safeguard national security. This is the principle established in the Basic Law. Article 23 of the Basic Law stipulates that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ""shall enact laws on its own"" for the sake of national security. But there had been a vacuum in relevant legislation due to opposition forces' obstruction. The city's unrest is directly related to the absence of the national security law. Eventually, it is logical for the central government to take action and for the Standing Committee of the NPC to legislate it. Neither the central government nor Chinese society wants to cancel ""one country, two systems."" However, ""one country, two systems"" does not mean few extreme forces in Hong Kong can collude with the US and other external forces to mess up the city, nor does it allow for violent protests - the so-called beautiful sight - to exist in Hong Kong. The National Security Law safeguards ""one country, two systems"" and will prevent Hong Kong from becoming the most turbulent city in Asia. Inside this barrier, democracy, freedom, pluralism and openness will not be suppressed. Instead, they will be more fully released.""One country, one system"" is an accusation made by Hong Kong's extreme forces and the US and other external forces. The Chinese mainland does not have such intentions. However, there is a malicious scheme to pull Hong Kong from China into the US' power circle and turn the city into a fulcrum for the US to contain China. Some forces in Hong Kong have been actively coordinating with such a scheme.These forces have dragged Hong Kong off the right track of development. Over the past few years, the city has suddenly become highly politicized and violent, caring not about its precious status as an international financial hub. It turned into a puppet of the US and lost its way.It is the National Security Law's core mission to heal these fatal injuries to Hong Kong. In a few hours before it was passed on Tuesday, several Hong Kong secessionist groups announced to disband. The Hang Seng index rose on Tuesday. All these will increase Hong Kong society's confidence in the implementation of the law.Before China passed the National Security Law for Hong Kong, the US announced to revoke its preferential treatment to Hong Kong. But the US only suspended the availability of export license exceptions and ended exports of US defense equipment to Hong Kong. It does not touch Hong Kong's status as a separate customs territory. Thus, the international public opinion generally believes its direct impact will be modest. China is prepared to deal with a worse situation, and the US' threat has failed.No city's vitality and prosperity can be endowed externally. With the help of the National Security Law, Hong Kong needs to step up to stabilize and refocus on economic and social development. Relying on the mainland's super economy, Hong Kong's status as an international financial hub cannot be taken away by anyone. The National Security Law for Hong Kong is not retroactive, and this makes 11 pm, June 30, 2020 a watershed. Those who are aware of the current situation and change their course will be safe. As for those who continue to do evil, the National Security Law for Hong Kong awaits. The law carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment - a tiger with teeth. In particular, the chief perpetrator will face severe punishment.

min_foreign_aff_9,2020-07-20,Ministry of Foreign Affairs,China,Ambassador Liu Xiaoming Gives Exclusive Live Interview on BBC's Andrew Marr Show,"On 19 July 2020, H.E. Ambassador Liu Xiaoming gave an exclusive live interview on BBC ONE's Andrew Marr Show about Hong Kong, Huawei, and Xinjiang. The full text is as follows:

Marr: Ambassador, welcome. Can I, first of all, ask you about Hong Kong? Are rights of dissent and freedom of speech still valued in Hong Kong?
Ambassador Liu: Fully respected. I think people talk about this National Security Law. National Security law is about restoring order and protecting the rights of the majority of people. It's targeted on a very small group of criminals who intend to endanger the national security.
Marr: But let me remind people what the National Security Law actually says. It says that Beijing now decides what breaks the law, not Hong Kong itself. Protesters can be arrested just for using placards. Police can search buildings without warrants and trials can be held in secret without a jury. Surely those laws break that ""One Country, Two Systems"" promise China originally made.
Ambassador Liu: That is wrong information. I don't know if you have read the National Security Law yet. First, I would say, the Law begins with the statement that China will continue to implement ""One Country, Two Systems"" and Hong Kong people will administer their affairs with a high degree of autonomy. 
The reason why this National Security Law was enacted is that in the past 23 years, although Hong Kong Special Administration Region government is entitled to enact its own law, according to Article 23 of the Basic Law, to protect the national security, because of the opposition -- because of these troublemakers' scaremongering -- the SAR government failed to enact it. But it is the Central Government's responsibility to take care of national security.
Marr: You said trouble makers. But Amnesty International, which is an organization much respected by many people watching this program, says there was a rapid deterioration in the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly, expression, and association as the Hong Kong authorities increasingly adopted mainland China's vague and all-encompassing definition of national security. 
Ambassador Liu: The Amnesty International is not respected in China because it has made really numerous false accusations against China. Never said a nice word, and has never been objective about China. That's the problem of them. We talked about Hong Kong situation last year, this turbulence and riots. Any responsible government has to take measures to address this situation. 
Marr: Why couldn't the existing laws be enough to do that, because there are quite strong existing laws? If they are really causing trouble, really trying to cause disruption in Hong Kong, they could have been dealt with by existing laws.
Ambassador Liu: That is exactly the reason why there should be a national security law, because the existing laws fail to contain this violence, looting, smashing, and storming the legislative council -- just like to storm the British parliament, because there's no law governing national security in Hong Kong for the past 23 years.
Marr: Isn't the real problem that you don't want people in Hong Kong to talk about democracy in Hong Kong.
President Trump said this. He says their freedom has been taken away. Their rights have been taken away. No special privileges, and with it goes Hong Kong, he said, because it will no longer be able to compete with free markets. A lot of people will be leaving Hong Kong. They are leaving Hong Kong for Australia, the United States, and for the UK. Will they be free to leave? 
Ambassador Liu: Certainly, they are free to leave. Hong Kong people enjoy unprecedented freedom after the handover for the past 23 years. Before the handover, what kind of freedom did they have? Did they have the freedom to elect their governor? The last governor was appointed by British government. But for the past 23 years, there were five Chief Executives elected by the Hong Kong people. 
Marr: Surely the fundamental truth is that under your new President, you have a nationalistic, more assertive regime in Beijing. And the real question is whether that regime can have a completely open relationship with free markets around the world. And Hong Kong is the epicenter for that. 
Ambassador Liu: I think you have a very wrong impression about what is going on in China. Let me give you an update. You don't trust our statement. You always regard it as propaganda. But it seems to me you trust Americans more. You don't regard them as propaganda. The Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government just issued a report. They did this report covering last 13 years. They did polling. The conclusion is, the Chinese people's rating of satisfaction for Chinese Communist Party and Chinese government is 93%, much higher than any western government, western leadership. So that's the fact about what is going on in China. 
Marr: We are going to get a response from the British government this coming week over Hong Kong, and there are reports that, for instance, Magnitsky act might be used to ban individual Chinese people from British territory. And also that the extradition treaty is going to be torn up. What would be China's reaction if that's the case?
Ambassador Liu: That is totally wrong. We never believe in unilateral sanction. We believe that the UN has the authority to impose sanction. If the UK government goes as far as to impose sanctions on any individual in China, China will certainly make resolute response to it. You've seen what happened between China and the United States. They sanctioned Chinese officials. We sanctioned their senators and officials. I do not want to see this tit for tat between China and the US happen in China-UK relations. I think the UK should have its own independent foreign policy rather than to dance to the tune of Americans, like what happened to Huawei. 
Marr: You've talked about the possibility of tit for tat or reprisals. Let me ask about Huawei because when the Huawei decision was announced, the Chinese foreign ministry said that it would severely undermine mutual trust and come at a cost. Can I ask you what the cost is? 
Ambassador Liu: We are still evaluating the consequences. This is a very bad decision. When this decision was announced, I said, this is a dark day for Huawei. It's a dark day for China-UK relations. It's an even darker day for the United Kingdom, because you will miss the opportunity to be a leading country. I happen to agree with Martin Jacques who is a British scholar and historian.
Marr: He knows China well.
Ambassador Liu: He knows China well. He wrote a book entitled When China Rules the World. He has this good line: In 1793, the Chinese emperor Qianlong told the English King ""We have the slightest need of your country's manufactures"", and that marked the start of 150-year decline of China. History has its cycle. 227 years later, in 2020, the UK told China, ""We do not have the slightest need of your 5G technology"". So I do not know what will happen in the next 150 years.
Marr: Is China -- looking at the TikTok's decision as well -- is China going to punish British companies like for instance Jaguar Land Rover which is operating in China as part of the response? 
Ambassador Liu: We do not want to politicize the economy. That is wrong. It's wrong for the United Kingdom to discriminate Chinese companies because of pressure from the United States. Some people are talking about ""national security risk"". There is no hard, solid evidence to say Huawei is a risk to the UK. They've been here for 20 years. They have made a huge contribution not only to the telecom industry of this country. They have fulfilled their corporate responsibility. They have helped the UK to develop. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has an ambitious plan to have full coverage of 5G by 2025. I think Huawei can deliver that. Huawei can be a big help. But now it seems to me the UK just kicks them out and, to use the media words, to purge them under the pressure from the United States. The US leaders have claimed credit for this. 

Marr: Let's turn to vaccine development. Now, Britain has accused Russia of trying to steal vaccine secrets. And when I had Rick Scott, the American senator from Florida, very, very close to Donald Trump on this program, he accused China of much the same thing. He said we have evidence -- that's the United States -- that China is trying to sabotage or slow down our ability to get this vaccine done. It came through our intelligence community. What's your response?
Ambassador Liu: Those China bashers have made countless accusations. I don't think I should spend time with you to refute their accusation against China. China is very open and China is working also with the UK scientists on vaccine. And President Xi made it very clear at the World Health Assembly that we'll make it a public good when it's ready. We want to make it accessible, especially in the poorest country in Africa. 
Marr: Let's turn to the single biggest problem at the moment between China and the West, which is the treatment of the Uighur people in north China. Let's look at some very disturbing drone footage that has been widely shared around the world. This is almost certainly over northern China, over Xinjiang. Can you tell us what is happening here? 
Ambassador Liu: I cannot see this as you do. This is not the first time you showed me one. I still remember last year, you showed me what your thought was happening in Xinjiang. Let me tell you this, Xinjiang…Have you been to Xinjiang yourself? 
Marr: No, I never have.
Ambassador Liu: Xinjiang is regarded as the most beautiful place in China? There's a Chinese saying you do not know how big Chinese is until you visited Xinjiang.
Marr: Ambassador, that is not a beautiful coverage however, is it?
Ambassador Liu: That is exactly what I'm going to tell you. Since 1990, Xinjiang has come under a challenge because of the thousands of terrorist attacks. People cannot...
Marr: That was 10 years ago. Can I ask you why people are kneeling, blindfolded and shaven, and being led to trains in northern China? What is going on there?
Ambassador Liu: I do not know where you get this video tape. Sometimes you need to transfer prisoners, you know, in any country.
Marr: But just what is happening here, Ambassador?
Ambassador Liu: I do not know where you got these video clips. 
Marr: These have been going around the world. They've been authenticated by western intelligence agencies and by Australian experts who say these are Uighur people being pushed on the train and then taken off to ... 
Ambassador Liu: Let me tell you this. The so-called Western intelligence agencies keep making up false accusations against China. They said one million or more Uighur have been persecuted. What is the population of Xinjiang? Forty years ago, its population is about 4, 5million. Now it's 11 million. And people say we have ethnic cleansing. But the population has been doubled in 40 years.
Marr: I'm so sorry to interrupt. But according to your own local government's statistics, the population growth in Uighur jurisdictions in that area has fallen by 84 percent between 2015 and 2018. 
Ambassador Liu: That's not right. I give you an official figure. I give you this figure as a Chinese ambassador. This is a very authoritative figure. In the past 40 years, the population in Xinjiang has doubled. So there's no so-called the restriction of population and there is no so-called forced abortion, and so on. 
Marr: But there is a program of forced sterilization being imposed on Uighur women at the moment. It's gone on for a long time. And people, who are finally coming out of China, are talking about it. And I've got the witness statement from a woman who's on Newsnight, a brave woman who talked about it openly. You can now watch. Here is somebody who went through the forcible sterilization program in China. 
Ambassador Liu: I can easily refute this accusation. There are some small groups of anti-Chinese people working against the interests of China. But the majority of Xinjiang people are happy with what is going on in Xinjiang. 
Ambassador Liu: In the past three years, there's no single terrorist attack in Xinjiang. Uighur People enjoy harmonious life and peaceful, harmonious coexistence with people of other ethnic groups. Uighur people are just one small portion of the Chinese population and even the Muslims in China. The majority of them are living happily, peacefully and harmoniously with other ethnic groups. We have a very successful ethnic policy. We treat every ethnic group as equal. 
(Video is played.)
Ambassador Liu: First of all, there's no so-called pervasive, massive, forced sterilization among Uighur people in China. This is totally against the truth. Secondly, the government policy is strongly opposed to this kind of practice. But I cannot rule out single cases. For any country, single cases exits. 
Marr: You cannot rule out at all, but the general view…
Ambassador Liu: The general view is that it is not a government policy and we treat every ethnic group in China as equal.
Marr: When we see interviews like that and we see people blindfolded and led off to trains to be taken to re-education camps. It reminds people in the West what was going on in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s. 
Ambassador Liu: That's completely wrong. There is no such a concentration camp in Xinjiang. I think we discussed that before. With regard to that video clip, I will get back to you. Your know, even if we are in the information age, there are all kinds of fake accusations against China. 
Marr: Let me remind you what the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide says. It says the genocide is killing people, causing serious bodily or mental harm, deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about a group's physical destruction, imposing measures intended to prevent births, and forcibly transferring children to another group. All of those things, it is alleged to have been happening in China and China is going to face accusations at the United Nations about this. 
Ambassador Liu: This is not true. The fact just shows the opposite. People in Xinjiang enjoy happy life. They call for order to be restored in Xinjiang. China is strongly opposed to any torture, persecution and discrimination of people of any ethnic group. This is not the case in China. The policy of the Chinese government is, as I said, every ethnic group in China is treated equal. That's the success story of Chinese ethnic policy. 
Marr: Is it any longer possible for the West to deal with the country which is so nationalistic and so much under the thumb of the Communist Party leadership?
Ambassador Liu: I do not agree with your description of China. It is not China that becomes ""so aggressive"". People say China is becoming very aggressive. That's totally wrong. China has not changed. It's the Western countries headed by the United States. They started this so-called ""new cold war"" on China. They have this sanction, they have this smearing and name-calling. Take what happened with this coronavirus. They still keep calling it ""China virus"" and ""Wuhan virus"". It's totally wrong, but we have to make a response. We do not provoke. But once we were provoked, we have to make response. 
Marr: Ambassador, thanks very much indeed for coming to talk to us today. Much appreciated. 
Ambassador Liu: Thank you.",5683
min_foreign_aff_10,2020-07-01,Ministry of Foreign Affairs,China,"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian's Regular Press Conference on July 1, 2020","In recent years, the US government has placed unwarranted restrictions on Chinese media agencies and personnel in the US, purposely made things difficult for their normal reporting assignments, and subjected them to growing discrimination and politically-motivated oppression. On February 18, 2020, the US designated five Chinese media agencies, namely, Xinhua News Agency, China Daily Distribution Corporation, China Global Television Network, China Radio International, and distributor for People's Daily in the US Hai Tian Development USA, as foreign missions. In the spirit of reciprocity, China demanded on March 18 that the China-based branches of Voice of America, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Time, and the Washington Post declare in written form information about their staff, finance, operation and real estate in China. 
On June 22, the US issued a new determination to designate four additional Chinese media agencies, namely, China Central Television, the People's Daily, the Global Times and China News Service, as foreign missions. China demands in retaliation that the Associated Press, United Press International, Columbia Broadcasting System, and National Public Radio declare in written form information about their staff, finance, operation and real estate in China within seven days starting from today. 
I need to point out that the above-mentioned measures are entirely necessary and reciprocal countermeasures that China is compelled to take in response to the unreasonable oppression the Chinese media organizations experience in the US. They are legitimate and justified self-defense in every sense. What the US has done is driven by a Cold War mentality and ideological bias. It has seriously tarnished the reputation and image of Chinese media organizations, seriously affected their normal operation in the US, and seriously disrupted people-to-people and cultural exchanges between the two countries. It has therefore exposed the hypocrisy of the self-styled advocate of press freedom. China urges the US to immediately change course, undo the damage, and stop its political oppression and arbitrary restrictions on Chinese media organizations. 
CCTV: As a small number of western countries dragged the national security legislation in Hong Kong to a Human Rights Council session, more than 50 countries in a joint statement expressed opposition to foreign interference in China's internal affairs and support to China's position and measures on Hong Kong-related issues. What is your comment? 
Zhao Lijian: On behalf of 53 countries, Cuba made a joint statement at this Session of the United Nations Human Rights Council, expressing their support for the passage of the Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. They believe that the move is beneficial for the steady and long-term success of the ""one country, two systems"" principle and Hong Kong's lasting prosperity and stability, and guarantees that Hong Kong residents can better exercise rights and freedoms in a safe environment. The statement stresses that Hong Kong is an inseparable part of China; Hong Kong's affairs are China's internal affairs, and external forces should not interfere. 
Every sovereign state has the inherent right to legislate in the interest of its national security. Establishing and improving the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security in the HKSAR at the state level by the NPC in accordance with the Constitution and the Basic Law is a necessary step to plug loopholes in the HKSAR national security legislation and uphold national sovereignty and security and a fundamental solution to ensure the steady and successful implementation of the ""one country, two systems"". The legislation targets a very narrow category of criminal acts and activities that endanger national security and protects the safety and rights and freedoms the vast majority of the Hong Kong residents enjoy in accordance with law. Most members of the international community fully understand and respect China's legitimate and lawful act to safeguard national security. Their just voice shows again that people have no problem telling right from wrong. Chief Executive Carrie Lam also delivered a speech representing Hong Kong via video link at the Human Rights Council session. She expressed support for the legislation, pointing out the necessity to establish and improve at the state level the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security in the HKSAR, the constitutional power of the state over the HKSAR, and legitimacy of this legislation. 
The national security legislation in the HKSAR is by no means a human rights issue, still less should it be politicized. A tiny number of external elements, with ulterior motives, have been meddling in this under the pretext of human rights. But nothing can cover up their arrogance, prejudice and real intention to flagrantly interfere in China's internal affairs. Some people advertise themselves as respecting rule of law, but what they have done showed no regard for the just voices of the international community calling for adherence to the principles of international law and basic norms of the international relations. We urge the relevant parties to grasp the situation, view the legislation in an objective and impartial way, stop fact-distorting and slandering acts, and stop interfering in Hong Kong matters and China's internal affairs. 

CGTN: On June 30, US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, White House National Security Council Spokesman John Ullyot respectively made statements on China's law on safeguarding national security in the Hong Kong SAR, accusing China of breaching international commitments and threatening to take tough measures. Does China have any comment? 
Zhao Lijian: The Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) was adopted by the NPC Standing Committee and has entered into force upon its promulgation. This Law will provide a strong institutional guarantee for comprehensively and accurately implementing the ""one country, two systems"" principle, effectively upholding the constitutional order in the HKSAR as prescribed by the Constitution and the Basic Law, and ensuring Hong Kong's enduring prosperity and stability. 
I'd like to reiterate that the legislation on safeguarding national security in the HKSAR is entirely China's internal affair that allows no foreign interference. The Chinese government is firm in its determination to safeguard China's sovereignty, security and development interests, to implement the principle of ""one country, two systems"" and to oppose any external interference in Hong Kong affairs. We urge the US side to view the Law in a fair, objective manner, immediately stop interfering in our internal affairs under the pretext of Hong Kong, and refrain from going further down the wrong path. 
China Daily: US Secretary of State Pompeo recently attacked the CPC and China's political system on multiple occasions, saying that the Chinese people's hopes and dreams should be distinguished from those of the CPC. Do you have any comment? 
Zhao Lijian: Today marks the 99th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China. I wish our Party a happy birthday. 
The CPC and the Chinese people share the same dream: to realize the great renewal of the Chinese nation. And it will come true. Today the CPC is thriving with vigor, but it must be a very bitter day for Mr. Pompeo and his like. They attempt to sever the close bond between the CPC and the Chinese people by lying and smearing. It's nothing but a pipe dream. 
Bloomberg News: A follow-up on the national security law. In the law it says that China will strengthen the management and services of foreign media and NGOs in the city. We are wondering if you can explain what management these foreign organizations will face? For example will there be new licensing or registration requirements? 
Zhao Lijian: The Chinese government is firmly determined to uphold China's sovereignty, security and development interests, to implement ""one country, two systems"" and to oppose interference in Hong Kong affairs by external elements. The Chinese side will continue handling relevant affairs in accordance with laws and regulations and offer necessary convenience. 
Associated Press of Pakistan: China and Pakistan established a joint cooperation mechanism on COVID-19 response and held the first video meeting under this mechanism. Do you have more details on that? What is China's consideration for setting up this mechanism? 
Zhao Lijian: On June 30, a China-Pakistan joint cooperation mechanism on COVID-19 response was officially established and the first video conference held. Representatives from the diplomatic, health, education and customs departments of the two sides attended the meeting. China and Pakistan have set up this mechanism to strengthen multi-agency coordination and communication between the two countries and promote exchanges and cooperation in various fields against the backdrop of the regular epidemic prevention and control. The meeting reached three consensus: 
First, we will continue to take targeted measures to resolutely control the spread of the epidemic or its resurgence in our respective countries and to stop cross-border transmission. Second, we will continue to deepen cooperation and experience-sharing in fighting COVID-19. China will continue to do its best to provide support and assistance according to Pakistan's needs. Third, we should continue to promote personnel exchanges and economic and trade cooperation on the premise of effective quarantine measures, be a good host to each other's students and nationals, and ensure smooth progress of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. 
China and Pakistan are all-weather strategic partners. After the outbreak of COVID-19, Pakistani President Alvi led a delegation to China at a critical moment in our fight, demonstrating firm support. Pakistan has also mobilized the whole country to provide material assistance to China. In response to Pakistan's needs, China has also provided material assistance through the government, military, enterprises and social organizations, sent medical experts and held video conferences to do its best to help Pakistan fight the epidemic. This demonstrates that the two countries, standing together through thick and thin, are a community with a shared future. We hope that the two sides will take the establishment of this mechanism as an opportunity to further join forces against COVID-19 and defeat the virus at an early date. 

Phoenix TV: I have two questions. First, at the UN Human Rights Council meeting, 27 countries including France, the UK and Germany called on China to reconsider the national security legislation in Hong Kong, which they alleged was threatening Hong Kong's freedom. Does the foreign ministry believe that the promulgation and implementation of the law will affect China's relations with these countries in the foreseeable future? Second, the Federal Communications Commission announced that it has released orders issuing final designations of Huawei and ZTE as companies posing a national security threat. What is your response? 
Zhao Lijian: On your first question, at the 44th regular session of the Human Rights Council on June 30, the UK, together with a small number of western countries, made unwarranted accusations against China on issues related to Hong Kong and others. Then and there, 53 countries voiced their support in a joint statement to China's policies regarding Hong Kong, urging the relevant countries to stop using these matters to interfere in China's internal affairs. It is pretty clear who enjoys popular support. The anti-China show staged by a handful of western countries ended in a fiasco. 
It must be pointed out that these countries are far from owning a good human rights record to boast and are certainly in no position to judge others on this front. We urge them to reflect on their own problems, stop politicizing and applying double standards on human rights issues, and stop interfering in others' internal affairs under the guise of human rights. They need to get a clear grasp of and follow the trend of the times and earnestly make concrete contributions to the sound development of the international human rights cause. 
As for your second question, China has made clear its position many times. The US has made a habit of abusing its state power to oppress certain countries and companies for unjustified and untenable reasons in the absence of any evidence. Acting like a bully in the economic sector does not suit its self-portrayed image as a guardian of the market economy. Banning US carriers from purchasing Huawei and ZTE products will not help improve the country's cyber security in any meaningful way, but will certainly have profound negative effects on connectivity for Americans in rural and disadvantaged areas across the US. The relevant US agency knows that clearly. 
Once again, we urge the US to stop making everything a matter of national security, stop its malicious slandering and accusation against China, and stop its unjustified oppression of certain Chinese companies. It should offer a fair, unbiased and non-discriminatory environment for the normal operations of Chinese companies in the US. 
Australian Broadcasting Corporation: The Australian government today announced a ten-year, 270-billion-dollar defense upgrade plan, including the purchase of long-range missiles because of changing circumstances in the Indo-Pacific region. Does China have any comment? 
Zhao Lijian: I'll leave that to Australia. All countries should avoid an arms race and refrain from purchasing unnecessary military equipment. 
AFP: I also want to ask about Canada recently issuing a travel advisory to Hong Kong, which says you may be at increased risk of arbitrary detention on national security grounds and possible extradition to mainland China in light of the national security law. What's China's response? 
Zhao Lijian: Hong Kong affairs are China's internal affairs that allow no foreign interference. Canada's claim cannot be justified. 
Bloomberg News: Another question on the African swine flu. We now know that it may be transmitted to humans, so we're wondering how many people have been infected? And if there is any details on who they are and how they got infected? 
Zhao Lijian: According to what we have learned from the competent authority, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA), the virus named G4 in the relevant article is an H1N1 subtype which is a common cause of seasonal flu and swine flu. Experts believe the conclusion of that article is not representative as the number of the test samples is not large enough. The competent authorities and experts will enhance monitoring, issue warnings in a timely manner and properly handle the situation. You may ask the MARA for more details. 
AFP: The EU recently included China on its list of safe countries, but only if China allows EU travelers to enter. When will China open its borders to EU travelers? 
Zhao Lijian: Since COVID-19 broke out, China has fought hard and achieved effective results, which is witnessed by all. In the meantime, we have been taking active measures to facilitate European personnel's travel to China for essential economic, trade and scientific activities. Going forward, as we continue to fight COVID-19 at an ongoing basis, the Chinese side will work to resume travel with Europe in a gradual and orderly manner through appropriate means. 
The following question was asked after the regular press conference. 
Q: Reports say senior Chinese and Indian commanders held talks at Chushul on June 30. Can you confirm this and offer more details? 
Zhao Lijian: Chinese and Indian military commanders held the third round talks on June 30. The two sides continue working towards implementing the consensus reached at the two earlier rounds of commander-level talks and made progress in effective measures by frontline troops to disengage and deescalate the situation. China welcomes that. We hope the Indian side will work with the Chinese side towards the same goal, keep up close communication through military and diplomatic channels, and ease the situation and lower the temperature along the border.",2420
xinhua_11,2020-05-16,Xinhua,China,"IPCC's report comprehensive, objective, fact-based, weighty: HKSAR chief executive","Video PlayerClose



Carrie Lam, chief executive of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), attends a press conference in Hong Kong, south China, May 15, 2020. (Xinhua/Lui Siu Wai)
HONG KONG, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Carrie Lam, chief executive of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) said Friday that the report released by the Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC) was comprehensive, objective, fact-based and weighty.
The IPCC, Hong Kong's police watchdog, released on Friday a report in regard to the social unrest in Hong Kong since last June.
The IPCC submitted to Lam its ""Thematic Study Report on the Public Order Events arising from the Fugitive Offenders Bill since June 2019 and the Police Actions in Response"" on Friday, which is available for viewing by members of the public.
""The IPCC has examined a large volume of information and has made detailed and objective representation of facts in the report,"" Lam said.
She condemned the violence amid the social unrest and stressed that the HKSAR government and the police will resolutely say no to violence.
Appreciating the responsibility and efforts of the IPCC and its secretariat, Lam said that they repeatedly checked and verified information in various ways in order to provide a fair and impartial report based on the facts.
However, Lam said that it was a very sad report as it recorded an overview of large-scale activities from June last year to March this year, with conflicts increasing, violence levels worsening and online hate speech against the police spreading.
From the perspective of the HKSAR government's governance, the whole social activity has deteriorated. If the spreading violence can not not be stopped effectively and in a timely manner, the ""one country, two systems"" principle and social stability will be shaken and Hong Kong will be pushed into the abyss, she said.
Lam said the police is undoubtedly professional, but of course, the government will hold any police officer accountable if they overstep their legal duties while enforcing the law.
However, she is also deeply saddened by the fact that since last year, there have been smears against the police in the society, and even some of the families of police officers have suffered various forms of injuries.
Lam hoped that the public would work together to rebuild a good relationship between the police and the community.
Lam stressed that the rule of law is the cornerstone of Hong Kong's success, the core value that ensures Hong Kong's continuous progress and development.
""One of the indispensable elements of the rule of law is that members of the public have to abide by the law. I, the HKSAR government and the police will resolutely say no to any violation of the law to prevent the deterioration of the law and order in Hong Kong, and ensure that members of the public will continue to enjoy their freedoms and rights within the legal boundaries,"" Lam stressed.",6326

(Xinhua/Liu Weibing)
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese lawmakers Tuesday voted to adopt the Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).
The law was passed unanimously at the 20th session of the Standing Committee of the 13th National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature.
President Xi Jinping signed a presidential order to promulgate the law, which goes into effect on the date of promulgation.
With 66 articles in six chapters, the law clearly defines the duties and government bodies of the HKSAR for safeguarding national security and four categories of offences -- secession, subversion, terrorist activities, and collusion with a foreign country or external elements to endanger national security -- and their corresponding penalties.
According to the law, the central government will set up an office in the HKSAR for safeguarding national security.
The HKSAR will establish a committee for safeguarding national security, which is under the supervision of and accountable to the central government. To be chaired by the HKSAR chief executive, the committee shall have a national security adviser designated by the central government. The Hong Kong police force will also set up a department for safeguarding national security, according to the law.
After the law was passed, the NPC Standing Committee consulted its HKSAR Basic Law Committee and the HKSAR government, and adopted on Tuesday afternoon, by a unanimous vote, a decision to list the law in Annex III to the HKSAR Basic Law.
The newly-adopted decision stipulates that the law shall be applied locally in the HKSAR by way of promulgation by the region.
HKSAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam said in a statement that the HKSAR government welcomes the passage of the law.
""I am confident that after the implementation of the national security law, the social unrest which has troubled Hong Kong people for nearly a year will be eased and stability will be restored, thereby enabling Hong Kong to start anew, focus on economic development and improve people's livelihood,"" she said.
WIDE SUPPORT
The law came after prolonged social unrest and escalating street violence had plunged Hong Kong into the gravest situation since its return to the motherland in 1997. Rampant activities of ""Hong Kong independence"" organizations and violent radicals as well as blatant interference by external forces have disrupted Hong Kong residents' daily life and threatened their safety.
Addressing the closing meeting of the NPC Standing Committee session, Li Zhanshu, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, said the unanimous passage of the law and the decision has reflected the common will of the Chinese people including Hong Kong compatriots.
Stressing that national security, social stability and the order of rule of law are the premises of the development of Hong Kong, Li said the legislation represents the aspirations of the people and an irresistible trend of the times.
In a statement, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council voiced firm support for the law, calling it a ""milestone"" event that will usher in a turning point for Hong Kong to end chaos and bring back order.
In a separate statement, the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR said the promulgation and implementation of the law at the occasion of the 23rd anniversary of Hong Kong's return to the motherland is an event worth celebrating for all Chinese people, including Hong Kong compatriots.
Nearly 2.93 million Hong Kong residents earlier signed a petition in support of the national security legislation during an eight-day campaign starting May 24.

china_daily_14,2020-06-20,China Daily,China,Wide support for proposed national security law,"Residents sign to support the national security legislation in Hong Kong, May 24, 2020. (EDMOND TANG/CHINA DAILY)HONG KONG - Various sectors of Hong Kong voiced strong support for the proposed national security law for the special administrative region as details of the draft were released on Saturday following a three-day session of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress in Beijing. READ MORE: Top legislature reviews draft HK national security lawTam Yiu-chung, Hong Kong’s delegate to the Standing Committee, said in an interview live-streamed on Hong Kong’s i-Cable News that the legislators gave full consideration to suggestions for the draft from Hong Kong, such as stating that Hong Kong’s government will take charge of enforcement and prosecutions under the law except in certain circumstances.Hong Kong’s common law system has been taken into consideration in writing the draft law, said Tam Yiu-chung, Hong Kong’s delegate to the NPC Standing CommitteeThe draft clearly states what crimes are offenses under the national security law, and protects the rights of Hong Kong residents stipulated under other Hong Kong laws and international covenants, Tam said.Hong Kong’s common law system has been taken into consideration in writing the draft law, he said, adding that he hopes it can bring stability to the city under the “one country, two systems” principle.The Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress wrapped up its bimonthly session on Saturday. According to the details, the proposed national security law will proscribe four types of acts endangering national security: secession, subversion of state power, terrorist activities and collusion with foreign and external forces to endanger national security. The penalties for the crimes have yet to be announced. Tam said he believes punishment may range from three to 10 years imprisonment.The Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, the largest party in the city’s legislature, expressed “full support” for the draft law, saying it has taken into account the different legal systems in Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland.ALSO READ: CE vows cooperation with NPC on national security legislationIn a statement issued on Saturday, DAB said it believes the law, which complies with international treaties by upholding human rights protection, will also be welcomed by the majority of Hong Kong residents. Earlier, more than 2.9 million people in Hong Kong signed a petition in support the proposed legislation. The party also suggested the Hong Kong government set up agencies and arrange enforcement officers in a timely manner, so that the law could be enforced as soon as it is passed to deal with violence and separatism and to stabilize the society.The arrangement that the chief executive will be responsible for appointing judges to preside over national-security-related cases strikes a balance between the central government’s concerns and the HKSAR’s high degree of autonomy, said Lau Siu-kai, vice-president of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies, the nation's leading think tank on Hong Kong affairs. Such an arrangement will ensure the judges in charge of relevant cases have an intimate knowledge of national security issues and it shows the central government respects the general practice of common law, Lau said.Lau said the national security agency to be established by the central government in the SAR will buttress the city’s ability to safeguard national security, as that isn’t an area of expertise within the local law enforcement agencies. The Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions, the city’s largest labor group comprising more than 420,000 members, also expressed firm support for the draft law, saying it contains “sufficient and clear” explanations and calling for local legislative work to begin quickly. The FTU will mobilize all its members and affiliates to back the legislation that may lift the city out of the current chaos, it said in a statement.",4028
hkgovt_15,2020-06-30,Hong Kong Gov't,Hong Kong,CE welcomes passage of The Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region by NPCSC,"In response to the passage of The Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (the National Security Law) by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) today (June 30), the Chief Executive, Mrs Carrie Lam, made the following statement:
 
     Safeguarding national security is the constitutional duty of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). The HKSAR Government welcomes the passage of the National Security Law by the NPCSC today. This national law has been listed in Annex III of the Basic Law in accordance with Article 18 of the Basic Law after consulting the NPCSC's Committee for the Basic Law of the HKSAR and the HKSAR Government.  
 
     The HKSAR is an inalienable part of the People's Republic of China and a local administrative region which enjoys a high degree of autonomy and comes directly under the Central People's Government. Safeguarding national sovereignty, security and development interests is the constitutional duty of the HKSAR and concerns every Hong Kong citizen. In view of the increasingly pronounced national security risks faced by the HKSAR, the enactment of a national security law at the state level is both necessary and urgent in order to plug the loophole in national security in Hong Kong. The legislation is an important step to improve the ""One Country, Two Systems"" institutional system as well as restore stability in Hong Kong society as soon as possible.
 
     ""The Decision on establishing and improving the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for the HKSAR to safeguard national security"" passed by the National People's Congress earlier clearly stipulated that the National Security Law listed in Annex III of the Basic Law will be applied by way of promulgation in the HKSAR. The National Security Law will come into effect later today. The HKSAR Government will complete the necessary procedure for publication by gazette as soon as possible to enable the implementation of the National Security Law in Hong Kong in tandem.
 
     The National Security Law seeks to practically and effectively prevent, curb and punish four types of crimes seriously endangering national security, namely acts of secession, subversion of state power, terrorist activities, and collusion with foreign or external forces to endanger national security. It only targets an extremely small minority of offenders while the life and property as well as various legitimate basic rights and freedoms enjoyed by the overwhelming majority of citizens will be protected.
 
     The HKSAR Government will, in accordance with the requirement of the National Security Law, establish the Committee for Safeguarding National Security to be chaired by the Chief Executive as soon as possible. Dedicated units in the Hong Kong Police Force and the Department of Justice will be responsible for implementing the relevant legal provisions in the National Security Law.
  
     I express my heartfelt thanks to the NPCSC for gauging the views of the HKSAR Government and various sectors of the community in Hong Kong as well as taking on board Hong Kong's practical situation during the law drafting process. I am also encouraged by the overwhelming support of the members of the public. I am confident that after the implementation of the National Security Law, the social unrest which has troubled Hong Kong people for nearly a year will be eased and stability will be restored, thereby enabling Hong Kong to start anew, focus on economic development and improve people's livelihood.
