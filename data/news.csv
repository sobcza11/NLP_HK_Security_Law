bbc_1,2020-06-30,BBC,UK,Hong Kong security law: What is it and is it worrying?,"China has passed a wide-ranging new security law for Hong Kong which makes it easier to punish protesters and reduces the city's autonomy. Critics have called it ""the end of Hong Kong"" - so what do we know, and what do people fear the most? Hong Kong was always meant to have a security law, but could never pass one because it was so unpopular. So this is about China stepping in to ensure the city has a legal framework to deal with what it sees as serious challenges to its authority. The details of the law's 66 articles were kept secret until after it was passed. It criminalises any act of: secession - breaking away from the countrysubversion - undermining the power or authority of the central governmentterrorism - using violence or intimidation against peoplecollusion with foreign or external forces The law came into effect at 23:00 local time on 30 June, an hour before the 23rd anniversary of the city's handover to China from British rule. It gives Beijing powers to shape life in Hong Kong it has never had before. Critics say it effectively curtails protest and freedom of speech - China has said it will return stability. The new law's key provisions include that: Crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces are punishable by a maximum sentence of life in prisonDamaging public transport facilities can be considered terrorismThose found guilty will not be allowed to stand for public officeCompanies can be fined if convicted under the lawBeijing will establish a new security office in Hong Kong, with its own law enforcement personnel - neither of which would come under the local authority's jurisdictionThis office can send some cases to be tried in mainland China - but Beijing has said it will only have that power over a ""tiny number"" of cases  In addition, Hong Kong will have to establish its own national security commission to enforce the laws, with a Beijing-appointed adviser Hong Kong's chief executive will have the power to appoint judges to hear national security cases, raising fears about judicial autonomyImportantly, Beijing will have power over how the law should be interpreted, not any Hong Kong judicial or policy body. If the law conflicts with any Hong Kong law, the Beijing law takes prioritySome trials will be heard behind closed doors.People suspected of breaking the law can be wire-tapped and put under surveillanceManagement of foreign non-governmental organisations and news agencies will be strengthenedThe law will also apply to non-permanent residents and people ""from outside [Hong Kong]... who are not permanent residents of Hong Kong"". Only a handful of people had seen the full text of the law before it was enacted, a source of considerable controversy in Hong Kong. They did not include the territory's Chief Executive, Carrie Lam. She told the UN Human Rights Council hours before it came into force that it would fill a ""gaping hole"" and not undermine Hong Kong's autonomy or its independent judiciary. She also promised it would not be retroactive. Beijing has said Hong Kong should respect and protect rights and liberties while safeguarding national security - but many still fear the loss of Hong Kong's freedoms with this law. ""It is clear that the law will have a severe impact on freedom of expression, if not personal security, on the people of Hong Kong,"" Professor Johannes Chan, a legal scholar at the University of Hong Kong, told the BBC before the passage of the law. There are reports of people deleting Facebook posts, and concerns that candidates opposing the national security law will be disqualified from running in elections. Many are also afraid Hong Kong's judicial independence will be eroded and its judicial system will look increasingly similar to mainland China's. The city is the only common law jurisdiction in China. ""Effectively, they are imposing the People's Republic of China's criminal system onto the Hong Kong common law system, leaving them with complete discretion to decide who should fall into which system,"" says Professor Chan. Some pro-democracy activists - such as Joshua Wong - have been lobbying foreign governments to help their cause. Such campaigning could become a crime in the future. He has now quit his Demosisto party. People also worry that a threat to Hong Kong's liberties could affect its attractiveness as a leading global business hub and economic powerhouse. Hong Kong was handed back to China from British control in 1997, but under a unique agreement - a mini-constitution called the Basic Law and a so-called ""one country, two systems"" principle. They are supposed to protect certain freedoms for Hong Kong: freedom of assembly and speech, an independent judiciary and some democratic rights - freedoms that no other part of mainland China has. Under the same agreement, Hong Kong had to enact is own national security law - this was set out in Article 23 of the Basic Law - but it never happened because of its unpopularity. Then, last year, protests over an extradition law turned violent and evolved into a broader anti-China and pro-democracy movement. China doesn't want to see that happen again. Many might ask how China can do this if the city was supposed to have freedoms guaranteed under the handover agreement. The Basic Law says Chinese laws can't be applied in Hong Kong unless they are listed in a section called Annex III - there are already a few listed there, mostly uncontroversial and around foreign policy. These laws can be introduced by decree - which means they bypass the city's parliament.

All the context you needProfile: Carrie Lam, Chief Executive of Hong KongHong Kong's year in seven intense emotions Critics say the introduction of the law this way amounts to a breach of the ""one country, two systems"" principle, which is so important to Hong Kong - but clearly it is technically possible to do this.

bbc_2,2020-07-01,BBC,UK,Hong Kong's new security law: Why it scares people,"China has introduced a new national security law for Hong Kong. The BBC's Michael Bristow takes a closer look at the detail, and what it will mean in practice. Lawyers and legal experts have said China's national security law for Hong Kong will fundamentally change the territory's legal system. It introduces new crimes with severe penalties - up to life in prison - and allows mainland security personnel to legally operate in Hong Kong with impunity. The legislation gives Beijing extensive powers it has never had before to shape life in the territory far beyond the legal system. Analysis of the law by NPC Observer, a team of legal experts from the United States and Hong Kong, identified what they consider a number of worrying aspects. ""Its criminal provisions are worded in such a broad manner as to encompass a swath of what has so far been considered protected speech,"" said a posting on its website. Article 29 is perhaps an example of this broad wording. It states that anyone who conspires with foreigners to provoke ""hatred"" of the Chinese government, or the authorities in Hong Kong, could have committed a criminal offence. Does that include criticism of China's governing Communist Party? On Wednesday at a media briefing, Hong Kong's Justice Secretary Teresa Cheng was asked to define exactly what the provision means. She was unable to give a clear answer. Article 55 also contains vague language. UK makes citizenship offer to Hong Kong residentsUK asylum for ex-consulate worker 'tortured in China' It gives Chinese mainland security operatives the right to investigate some national security cases that are ""complex"", ""serious"" or ""difficult"". As the NPC Observer team note, these words are ""highly subjective and malleable"". Human rights organisations have pointed out how the law seems to undermine protections previously offered to defendants. Trials can be held in secret (Article 41) and without a jury (Article 46). Judges can be handpicked (Article 44) by Hong Kong's chief executive, who is answerable directly to Beijing. The law also reverses a presumption that suspects will be granted bail (Article 42). That same provision also appears to suggest there is no time limit on how long suspects can be held. It says only that cases should be handled in a ""timely manner"". THE TEXT: What it is and why Hong Kong is worriedWHAT COULD HAPPEN: Life sentences for breaking the law and moreRESIDENTS REACT: 'End of one country, two systems'PRO-DEMOCRACY MOVEMENT: Minutes after new law, voices quit Entire cases - from investigation to judgement to punishment - can be simply handed over to the mainland authorities (Article 56). Foreign nationals outside of Hong Kong face prosecution under the law (Article 38). Donald Clarke, writing for the China Collection, a blog focusing on Chinese issues, wrote that a US newspaper columnist advocating Tibetan independence might fall foul of the law. ""If you've ever said anything that might offend the PRC (People's Republic of China) or Hong Kong authorities, stay out of Hong Kong,"" he wrote. Mr Clarke, of the George Washington University Law School, said the biggest worry was the institutions and processes that the law has established. The legislation allows China to set up the Office for Safeguarding National Security in Hong Kong - a mainland Chinese body to be staffed by mainland Chinese personnel. Article 60 makes it clear that anyone who works there does not have to abide by Hong Kong's laws. They shall not be subject to ""inspection, search or detention"". As Mr Clarke wrote: ""They are untouchable."" Claudia Mo, an opposition lawmaker in Hong Kong, said the aim of China's national security legislation was to ""stun Hong Kong into nothingness"". ""People will be so petrified, so frightened and intimidated, that they wouldn't dare say anything or do anything in opposition,"" she said. Of course, that is not the view in Beijing. Zhang Xiaoming, of China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, said on Wednesday that the law would help return stability to the territory. It will bring Hong Kong more in line with the laws, procedures and practices of mainland China. Whether or not you think the legislation was necessary, it is impossible to deny its significance. As Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam put it: this is a turning point."
bbc_18,2020-06-30,BBC,UK,Hong Kong security law: Anger as China's Xi signs legislation,"The UK, EU and Nato have expressed concern and anger after China passed a controversial security law giving it new powers over Hong Kong. The law makes secession, subversion of the central government, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces punishable by up to life in prison. It took effect from 2300 local time (1500 GMT) on Tuesday. Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam defended the law, saying it filled a ""gaping hole"" in national security. One key pro-democracy group said it was now ceasing all operations. Demosisto announced the move on Facebook after Joshua Wong, one of Hong Kong's most prominent activists, said he was leaving the group, which he had spearheaded. Minutes after new law, pro-democracy voices quit The law has come into effect just a day before the 23rd anniversary of the return of sovereignty to China - a day that usually draws large pro-democracy protests. China says the law is needed to tackle unrest and instability linked to a broadening pro-democracy movement. China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried?The city of two masks faces a new crisis Opponents say it undermines the autonomy set out in Hong Kong's mini-constitution, the Basic Law, which was agreed when the territory's sovereignty was returned by the UK in 1997. Civil liberties such as free speech, the right to protest and an independent and robust judiciary are at risk, they say. There has been a mixture of concern for personal safety and defiance at the news. Demosisto said several members had asked to be delisted and it had decided to ""dissolve and stop all meetings"". It said that the fight against ""totalitarian oppression"" would have to continue in a ""more flexible manner"". Joshua Wong said the law marked ""the end of Hong Kong that the world knew before"". Hong Kong's year in seven intense emotionsThe background you need on Hong Kong's protests But Democratic Party leader Wu Chi-wai said he would defy a ban on a ""handover day"" march scheduled for Wednesday, the South China Morning Post reports. He will be joined by Figo Chan, of the Civil Human Rights Front, who urged people to take to the streets, saying: ""We are aware of the risks of being prosecuted. But we insist on taking the lead, as we want to tell Hongkongers not to fear."" Police plan to have 4,000 riot officers on standby. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab urged China to ""step back from the brink"" and respect the rights of the people of Hong Kong. He said: ""The success of Hong Kong, the entrepreneurial spirit, the vibrancy, the economic success, has been built on its autonomy in 'one country, two systems'... That clearly is at threat."" What is the BNO and what does the UK move mean? The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, said: ""It risks seriously undermining the high degree of autonomy of Hong Kong and will have a detrimental impact on the judiciary and the rule of law and we deplore this decision."" The last UK governor of Hong Kong, Lord Patten, said the law marked the end of one-country, two-systems. Meanwhile, Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said: ""It is clear that China does not share our values - democracy, freedom, and the rule of law."" Japan called the law ""regrettable"" and Taiwan even warned its citizens of risks in visiting Hong Kong. The US has already begun taking steps to end Hong Kong's special status trade relationship, a move China on Tuesday said would be met with unspecified ""countermeasures"". Analysis by Stephen McDonell, BBC China correspondent Hong Kong's sweeping new security law is a frighteningly open-ended tool to suppress political agitation. Like similar laws on the Chinese mainland it appears that it can be manipulated to meet the needs of the Communist Party as required to crush almost any action deemed threatening. Unlike elsewhere in China, Hong Kong has an independent judiciary. For this reason, the Party's leadership was not going to leave interpretation of this law in the hands of just any old judges. No. Those who'll be allowed to preside in these matters will be hand-picked by Carrie Lam, the city's leader who was effectively installed by Beijing. So, prior to the new security bill, which actions by activists - no matter how subversive - could not be dealt with under existing laws? What were ""extremists"" getting away with to warrant this new legislation? Bomb making? No. Smashing up buildings? No. Meeting with international NGOs to talk about the city's deteriorating freedoms? Ahhhh. Perhaps. Publicly advocating Hong Kong independence? Almost certainly. The more that Beijing, under Xi Jinping's leadership, has sought to control Hong Kong, the more it has driven residents into the pro-democracy camp. But he is playing a long game. Sure, handover promises to the UK were made but he was not going to let some Western attachment to liberty trump loyalty to the motherland. Not on his watch. Enter the security law. The law, announced by Beijing in May, will make criminal any act of secession, subversion of the central government, terrorism or collusion with foreign or external forces. State news agency Xinhua said the six-chapter law had 66 articles, clearly setting out the terms of the four offences. Beijing to set up new security office in Hong Kong A new office in Hong Kong will deal with national security cases, but will also have other powers such as overseeing education about national security in Hong Kong schools. In addition, the city will have to establish its own national security commission to enforce the laws, with a Beijing-appointed adviser. Hong Kong's chief executive will have the power to appoint judges to hear national security cases, a move which has raised fears about judicial independence. Importantly, Beijing will have power over how the law should be interpreted. If the law conflicts with any Hong Kong law, the Beijing law takes priority. In a video address to the UN Human Rights Council on Tuesday, Chief Executive Carrie Lam said crimes under the new law would be clearly defined. She said the law would only target a ""small minority"" and would not undermine Hong Kong's autonomy, adding: ""We respect differences in opinion."" In recent years, Hong Kong has seen waves of protests demanding more rights. Last year, rallies over a now-scrapped bill permitting extraditions to the mainland turned violent and fuelled a broad pro-democracy movement."
bbc_19,2020-06-30,BBC,UK,"Hong Kong security law: Minutes after new law, pro-democracy voices quit","On Tuesday morning, the news started to break from Beijing: China had passed a new security law in Hong Kong. The law criminalises any act of secession, subversion, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces. And within minutes, the effect was obvious. Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong began to quit, fearful of the new law, and the punishment it allows. Here is some of the reaction from them, other governments, and campaign groups. Secretary-general and founding member of pro-democracy group Demosisto, and key figure in 2014 Umbrella movement ""It [the law] marks the end of Hong Kong that the world knew before,"" said Mr Wong, after announcing he was quitting Demosisto. ""From now on, Hong Kong enters a new era of reign of terror, just like Taiwan's White Terror, with arbitrary prosecutions, black jails, secret trials, forced confessions, media clampdowns and political censorship. ""With sweeping powers and ill-defined law, the city will turn into a secret police state. Hong Kong protesters now face high possibilities of being extradited to China's courts for trials and life sentences."" Founding chairman of Demosisto, former student leader On Facebook, Mr Law said the law marked the start of a ""bloody cultural revolution"". But, despite quitting Demosisto, he said he would continue to fight for democracy ""in a personal capacity"". He added on Twitter: ""Stay strong, my friends. Hong Kong people will not give up."" Hours after Mr Law, Mr Wong, and others quit Demosisto, the group announced it would disband entirely. ""We will meet again,"" it said. Pro-independence group Minutes after the law was passed, the group said on Twitter it was disbanding in Hong Kong, but would continue its work overseas. It reportedly has branches in Taiwan and the UK. Its Hong Kong spokesman, Baggio Leung - who was briefly a member of parliament in 2016 - is also leaving the group. But the group said the end of operations in Hong Kong did not mean its fight was over. ""Today is not the end point,"" it said. ""From now on, China will have the power to impose its own laws on any criminal suspect it chooses,"" said the head of Amnesty's China team, Joshua Rosenzweig. ""The fact that the Chinese authorities have now passed this law without the people of Hong Kong being able to see it tells you a lot about their intentions. ""Their aim is to govern Hong Kong through fear from this point forward."" ""The move severely impacts Hong Kong society's freedom, human rights and stability,"" said cabinet spokesman Evian Ting, as the Taiwanese government warned its citizens of an increased risk in visiting Hong Kong. ""The government strongly condemns it and reiterates its support for the people of Hong Kong as they strive for democracy and freedom."" Hong Kong government leader, speaking before the law was passed ""There is no need for us to worry,"" Ms Lam said in May. ""In the last 23 years, whenever people worried about Hong Kong's freedom of speech and freedom of expression and protest, time and again, Hong Kong has proven that we uphold and preserve those values."" ""The core values in terms of the rule of law, the independence of the judiciary, the various rights and freedoms enjoyed by people, will continue to be there,"" she added."
bbc_20,2020-07-08,BBC,UK,Hong Kong security law: Beijing security office opens in Hong Kong,"A new national security office has been officially opened in Hong Kong, placing mainland Chinese agents in the heart of the territory for the first time. The office is one element of a sweeping new law which outlaws criticism of China's government. Hong Kong was, until the law was passed, the only part of China not subject to such policies. The law has caused alarm in Hong Kong but officials say it will restore stability after violent protests. Chief Executive Carrie Lam said on Tuesday that it was ""actually relatively mild as far as national security laws are concerned"" and would enable Hong Kongers to ""exercise their rights and freedoms without being intimidated and attacked"". The temporary base of the new office is a hotel in Causeway Bay, the commercial district next to Victoria Park, which had long been the focal point of pro-democracy protest marches and rallies in Hong Kong. An opening ceremony was held on Wednesday morning, attended by dignitaries including Chief Executive Carrie Lam and Zheng Yanxiong, the hardliner chosen by Beijing to head up the new office. The Chinese flag was raised outside the office, amid heavy security including a bomb disposal unit. Luo Huining, head of the existing Hong Kong-Beijing liaison office, said the office would be ""the envoy for Hong Kong's safety and is also the gatekeeper of national security"". Security agents from the mainland who are based in the new office will, for the first time, have the power to investigate people for a wide range of crimes defined by the new law, and potentially extradite them to the mainland for trial. Chinese courts, which are controlled by the Communist Party, have a close to 100% conviction rate. The legislation is the most sweeping change to the political landscape of Hong Kong since it was handed back to China by the UK in 1997. It has been heavily criticised globally for undermining freedoms guaranteed under the ""one country, two systems"" agreed as part of the handover, which gave the territory a lot of control over how it ran itself. Several prominent figures from the anti-Beijing protest movement have left Hong Kong or closed their social media accounts in the wake of the law. Several social media companies have said they will stop co-operating with the Hong Kong police on requests for user data over concerns about how it will be used, while  TikTok has said it is pulling out of Hong Kong entirely."
bbc_21,2020-07-05,BBC,UK,Hong Kong security law: Pro-democracy books pulled from libraries,"Books by pro-democracy figures have been removed from public libraries in Hong Kong in the wake of a controversial new security law. The works will be reviewed to see if they violate the new law, the authority which runs the libraries said. The legislation targets secession, subversion and terrorism with punishments of up to life in prison. Opponents say it erodes the territory's freedoms as a semi-autonomous region of China. Beijing rejects this. Hong Kong's sovereignty was handed back to China by Britain in 1997 and certain rights were supposed to be guaranteed for at least 50 years under the ""one country, two systems"" agreement. Since the security law came into effect on Tuesday, several leading pro-democracy activists have stepped down from their roles. One of them - one-time student leader and local legislator Nathan Law - has fled the territory. At least nine books have become unavailable or marked as ""under review"", according to the South China Morning Post newspaper. They include books authored or co-authored by Joshua Wong, a prominent pro-democracy activist, and pro-democracy politician Tanya Chan. On Saturday, Mr Wong tweeted that the new law ""imposes a mainland-style censorship regime"" on Hong Kong, calling it ""one step away from ... actual book banning"". The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter Beijing has dismissed criticism of the law, saying it is necessary to stop the type of mass pro-democracy protests seen in Hong Kong during much of 2019, which at times exploded into very violent clashes between protesters and police. Why people are scared of Hong Kong's new lawMinutes after new law, voices quit It has rejected complaints by the UK and other Western nations that it is in breach of guarantees it made to protect Hong Kong's unique freedoms as interference in its internal affairs. By Danny Vincent, BBC News, Hong Kong Hong Kong was promised certain political freedoms for 50 years after the handover. It was guaranteed rights such as freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and an independent judicial system. To many Hong Kong residents, the national security law represents a premature end to those freedoms. Supporters say the law will help to restore order after a year of protest. But critics say it is being used to criminalise opposition to Beijing. The removal of political books from public libraries would have been unimaginable just a week ago. In today's Hong Kong, business owners remove messages of support for the protest movement from their premises, fearful that they could be interpreted as attempts at inciting subversion. So far, 10 people have been arrested for allegedly violating the new law. But fear and uncertainty are widespread. Protesters now call for demonstrators to hold up blank placards at marches. They fear that their words could lead to life imprisonment. The law is wide-ranging, and gives Beijing powers to shape life in Hong Kong that it has never had before. The law makes inciting hatred of China's central government and Hong Kong's regional government offences. It also allows for closed-door trials, wire-tapping of suspects and the potential for suspects to be tried on the Chinese mainland. Acts including damaging public transport facilities - which often happened during the 2019 protests - can be considered terrorism. There are also concerns over online freedom as internet providers might have to hand over data if requested by police."
bbc_22,2020-06-30,BBC,UK,Hong Kong security law: Life sentences for breaking China-imposed law,"People in Hong Kong could face life in jail for breaking a controversial and sweeping new security law imposed by China. The legislation came into force on Tuesday but the full text was only revealed hours afterwards. It was brought in by Beijing following increasing unrest and a widening pro-democracy movement. Critics say the new law effectively curtails protest and undermines Hong Kong's freedoms. The territory was handed back to China from British control in 1997, but under a unique agreement supposed to protect certain freedoms that people in mainland China do not enjoy - including freedom of speech. Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, defended the law, saying it filled a ""gaping hole"" in national security. Details have been closely guarded and the Beijing-backed politician admitted she had not seen the draft before commenting. Why are there protests in Hong Kong? All the context you needDo protests ever work in China? But Ted Hui, an opposition legislator, told the BBC: ""Our rights are (being) taken away; our freedom is gone; our rule of law, our judicial independence is gone."" The UK, EU and Nato have all expressed concern and anger, while pro-democracy groups have started to disband amid fears of immediate reprisals. Washington, which also urged Beijing to reconsider, had already begun to end the preferential treatment Hong Kong enjoys in trade and travel with the US, bringing it in line with mainland China. Full details of the new law only emerged after it had come into effect at about 23:00 local time on Tuesday (16:00 BST). It applies to both permanent and non-permanent residents. Among the details: Crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces are punishable by a minimum sentence of three years, with the maximum being life Inciting hatred of China's central government and Hong Kong's regional government are now offences under Article 29Damaging public transport facilities can be considered terrorism - protesters often targeted city infrastructure during the long-running demonstrations Those found guilty will not be allowed to stand for public officeBeijing will establish a new security office in Hong Kong, with its own law enforcement personnel - neither of which would come under the local authority's jurisdictionHong Kong's chief executive can appoint judges in national security cases, and the justice secretary can decide whether or not there is a juryDecisions made by the national security commission, set up by local authorities, cannot be challenged legallyChina also says it will take over prosecution in cases which are considered ""very serious"", while some trials will be heard behind closed doors.Management of foreign non-governmental organisations and news agencies will be strengthenedThe law can also apparently be broken from abroad by non-residents, under Article 38 The law will not apply to acts which happened before it came into force. Under the national security law, many of the acts of protest that have rocked Hong Kong over the past year could now be classed as subversion or secession… and punished with up to life in prison. The city's pro-Beijing leader, Carrie Lam, said the law was long overdue. Fearing repercussions, political activists are resigning their posts and one pro-democracy protester, who asked to remain anonymous, told me that ordinary people are now deleting posts on social media. Many people are just stopping talking about politics, and stopping talking about freedom and democracy because they want to save their own lives. They want to save their freedom and avoid being arrested. One contact of mine, a lawyer and human rights activist, sent me a message shortly after the law was passed. Please delete everything on this chat, he wrote. The reaction began the moment the law - which was first announced six weeks ago - was signed by China's President Xi Jinping. Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong began to quit immediately, fearful of the new law, and the punishment it allows. According to the South China Morning Post, pro-democracy businesses began clearing away any sign they had once supported the protests. Joshua Wong, secretary-general and founding member of pro-democracy group Demosisto, warned the city would ""turn into a secret police state"". ""Beijing's promise to the world that Hong Kong will have a high degree of autonomy is proven to be a lie,"" opposition legislator Ted Hui told the BBC's Newshour programme. But despite the risks, some remained determined to go ahead with the banned traditional 1 July rally planned for Wednesday, amid reports of large numbers of police descending onto Hong Kong's financial district. Read more: Minutes after new law, pro-democracy voices quit The move also provoked international reaction, with the UK's Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, saying China had broken the promises it had made to the people of Hong Kong under the terms of the 1997 handover. He added that the government ""fully"" intends to see through plans to change visa rules, offering millions of people in Hong Kong a way to acquire UK citizenship. That agreement enshrined the ""one country, two systems"" principle in a document called the Basic Law - Hong Kong's mini constitution - for 50 years. The Basic Law protects rights such as freedom of assembly and freedom of speech - neither of which exist in mainland China - and also sets out the structure of governance for the territory. Julian Braithwaite, Britain's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, told the UN Human Rights Council that the law ""has clear implications for human rights"". Mr Braithwaite, speaking on behalf of 27 nations, urged China to reconsider."
cnn_11,2020-07-03,CNN,US,Hong Kong's security law could have a chilling effect on press freedom,"London (CNN Business)Hong Kong insists its vibrant community of journalists has nothing to fear from the national security legislation China imposed on the city this week. But press freedom advocates worry about creeping self-censorship, and there are signs that the new law may already be having a chilling effect.In what was once seen as a safe haven of free speech for local and foreign news organizations operating in the region, journalists and their sources are growing increasingly wary that as China takes a firmer grip on Hong Kong, they could be prosecuted. The new law applies to any person in Hong Kong, both locals and foreign nationals. It criminalizes actions like calling for Hong Kong independence, or working with a foreign entity ""to incite hatred"" toward the Chinese government. A new enforcement committee will ""strengthen the management"" of NGOs and media working in Hong Kong. The police will also have new powers to search premises, wiretap suspects and order people to ""delete information or provide assistance."" Article 4 of the law says ""the freedoms of speech, of the press, of publication, of association, of assembly, of procession and of demonstration"" will be protected. But it also criminalizes the leaking of ""state secrets,"" a vague term commonly used in China to cover a range of issues deemed to be in the national interest and which has been used in the past to imprison journalists like Gao Yu on the mainland. That could deter both journalists and sources from reporting or collaborating on stories relating to government affairs. Why China's national security law could change Hong Kong foreverHong Kong holds a unique position in the region, as it is home to the only free press in any area or territory administered by the Chinese government. But there's been no clear guidance on what the new security law means for the city's long-established media community.Read MoreDeliberate ambiguity That the legislation lacks specifics is deliberate, not an omission, according to experts such as Sophie Richardson, China Director of Human Rights Watch (HRW).""This law is so vague and so overboard that it could potentially apply to just about any kind of behavior or speech and that's exactly the Chinese government's goal: It wants everyone to start and think 'Oh wait a minute does this constitute sedition? Oh wait a minute, is that collusion?'"" Richardson said. The vague nature of the law will lead to self-censorship, which may be precisely what Beijing wants, said Steven Butler, Asia director for the Committee To Protect Journalists (CPJ).""The Chinese Communist Party may achieve what it wants to achieve without ever having to enforce the law,"" he said.Both Butler and Richardson said the new law could bring Hong Kong more in line with how the media is treated in China, one of the worst countries in the world for press freedom according to Reporters Without Borders and where self-censorship is commonplace.How the national security law is bringing China's authoritarian legal system to Hong KongHong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam has asserted that it won't affect freedom of speech, enshrined in the city's 1997 de facto constitution called the Basic Law. But the new law may supersede such protections, Butler said.When asked by CNN in a press conference on Wednesday whether people would be allowed to criticize the new law, Lam said: ""If individuals including reporters from CNN are discharging their role and feel something is not right and want to criticize then I don't see why that would be an offense under this law.""But, she warned, ""If there is more, if you are involved in organizing or colluding that's another matter. It's a question of evidence and the law.""Dire consequences?Press freedoms in Hong Kong have been under pressure in recent years, Butler said, adding that reporters covering pro-democracy protests in the city have been targeted by police. In 2018, the Financial Times' Asia news editor Victor Mallet was denied a routine extension of his visa, months after he moderated a debate at the Foreign Correspondents' Club that featured a pro-independence activist.For journalists who are Hong Kong citizens, the consequences of breaking the new law could be dire. They could be tried behind closed doors and sentenced to life imprisonment. Those found guilty of participating or assisting in crimes can also face between three and 10 years in jail. Hong Kong authorities have not outlined any specifics on how the new enforcement committee for managing media will affect foreign reporters, who — unlike their counterparts in mainland China — do not require specific journalist visas. China hits back at US with new media restrictions as tensions riseThose visas for foreign reporters in mainland China come with strict oversight and the government has in the past expelled journalists, including around a dozen recently from the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post.Then there are the sources and interview subjects, many of whom are likely to be even more wary of speaking to the media — something reporters in mainland China already struggle with, HRW's Richardson said.Butler, at the CPJ, said in recent days that journalists have already been asked by sources and interview subjects to delete previous articles or communications with sources that could be viewed as seditious. CNN, which has a major bureau in the city, has spoken to sources who have expressed reluctance to participate in interviews. Within hours of the bill's passage, sources asked that past WhatsApp chats be deleted and expressed caution about being quoted in articles about the law.Waiting for 'test' casesButler and Richardson said it is only a matter of time before there is a ""test case,"" where a reporter will be tried under the new law. ""I won't be surprised if some journalists wind up being charged under this law at some point in the not too distant future,"" Richardson said. For now, news organizations and press freedom advocates can only try to lobby the Hong Kong government.Security law could hurt Hong Kong as a global business hub""Hong Kong has been a leader in supporting the rights of a free press in Asia for decades and it is essential that it continues to do so, particularly given the treatment of members of the independent press within mainland China and the global nature of the coronavirus pandemic,"" a New York Times spokesperson told CNN Business, adding that it is closely monitoring the situation. Butler said he hopes Hong Kong's status as a financial center and an important Asian gateway for Western companies will protect its press freedoms. ""You can't have an international finance center without freedom of the speech and press,"" he said."

KEY FACTS


Police arrested 370 people Wednesday during the city’s largest protest in months in defiance of Covid-19 restrictions; of those arrests, 10 were reportedly arrested for breaking the new law, according to the Wall Street Journal. 


The national security law, adopted Tuesday in Beijing, passed after the widespread protests in Hong Kong last year and allows authorities to crack down on dissenters with long jail sentences for charges that experts say are defined in vague terms that could allow for broad interpretation by China.



Critics of the new law say it effectively ends the autonomy of Hong Kong, which has existed under a ""one country, two systems"" agreement since the British gave Hong Kong back to China in 1997, which occurred 23 years ago from Wednesday.



The new law has been condemned globally; on Tuesday, U.S. Congress introduced a bipartisan bill that would give some Hong Kongers refugee status.


British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has made an offer to allow the  3 million Hong Kong citizens eligible for a British overseas passport a pathway to citizenship.


China has defended the new law, saying it is essential to restore peace in Hong Kong and that it would not permit domestic policies to be swayed by foreign influence. 


TANGENT
The new law has had a chilling effect on pro-democracy activism in Hong Kong. Several activist groups have already disbanded as a result of the new laws. According to the New York Times, a Hong Kong museum dedicated to preserving the memory of the 1989 massacre in Tienanmen Square is working to quickly digitize its collection in case authorities come to take their archive.
KEY BACKGROUND
The law lists charges like subversion, secession and terrorism as carrying punishments up to life in prison. Causing damage to public transportation, as was commonly seen during protests last year, could be grounds for a terrorism charge, according to the BBC. The law allows for more serious offenses to be extradited to China to be heard by Chinese courts, drawing comparisons to the extradition bill that kicked off the protests last year that was later withdrawn. China can even waive a trial by jury and restrict access to trials. It also permits Beijing to set up a new security agency in Hong Kong to keep an eye on the enforcement of the new law that is above judicial review or existing Hong Kong laws. The new law also applies to non-Hong Kong residents living abroad, which means foreigners found in violation could be arrested as soon as they step foot in Hong Kong according to the BBC.

nytimes_5,2020-06-28,NY Times,US,What China’s New National Security Law Means for Hong Kong,"Chinese lawmakers have approved a national security law, drastically curbing political protest and dissent in Hong Kong and adding to Beijing’s tensions with Western powers.The National People’s Congress Standing Committee — an arm of China’s Communist Party-run legislature — discussed the draft law twice this month, including a three-day session that started on Sunday. But even as Hong Kong news media reported on Tuesday that the law had passed, the city’s residents were still waiting to see its full text. Here is what the move means for Hong Kong.A law to curb opposition in Hong Kong. China’s Communist Party leaders have long worried about opposition to their rule in Hong Kong, which was a British colony until 1997. The Basic Law, which enshrines Hong Kong’s special legal status, says the semiautonomous territory should enact legislation that outlaws “any act of treason, secession, sedition, subversion.” Full details have not been released, but the security law is expected to deter speech, protests and news media critical of the Chinese government, threatening the territory’s independent press and democratic opposition.Many Hong Kong residents are proudly protective of their rights under the territory’s separate legal system and have opposed attempts to pass such legislation. A previous push by Hong Kong’s leaders to enact a national security law foundered in 2003 after nearly 500,000 people joined a street protest against it.China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, has been impatient to impose control over Hong Kong. After the territory erupted in monthslong protests last year over a proposed extradition law, a Communist Party meeting in October demanded steps to “safeguard national security” in Hong Kong.The National People’s Congress Standing Committee usually meets every two months or so. This time, the committee met just a little over a week after it first discussed the security legislation at its last session. The timing of the latest session suggested that Mr. Xi wanted the law passed before July 1, the 23rd anniversary of Hong Kong’s return to Chinese sovereignty. Beijing imposes security agencies. Legal experts had been uncertain how Mr. Xi could introduce a national security law into Hong Kong without going through the city’s Legislative Council, a body stacked with pro-Beijing members who have, nonetheless, hesitated to take such a contentious step.But Mr. Xi made a bold move to break the impasse in May, when a full session of the National People’s Congress nearly unanimously passed a resolution empowering the Congress’s Standing Committee to bring state security legislation into the Basic Law.The central government’s decision to impose a law effectively circumvents the Hong Kong legislature. Even Hong Kong politicians who have endorsed the law, including the territory’s top official, Carrie Lam, have said they have not been shown the full text by Beijing, which will bring into Hong Kong new crimes like inciting separatism and “colluding with foreign powers.”The law will also establish a new security agency in the territory to enforce the security restrictions, and Beijing will create its own separate security arm in Hong Kong, empowered to investigate special cases and collect intelligence, according to a summary issued by China’s legislature.The legislation also gives the territory’s chief official, who must answer to Beijing, the power to decide which judges are empowered to hear trials for state security charges, limiting the autonomy of the city’s judiciary.Many residents fear the law. Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s local leader, has sought to reassure the public that their “legitimate rights and freedoms” will be safeguarded. She and other politicians who support the law have also said that it will target only a tiny minority of lawbreakers.Pro-democracy activists have denounced the proposed law, and the Hong Kong Bar Association has called it unconstitutional.The Hong Kong police force has denied applications from three groups — the League of Social Democrats, the Civil Human Rights Front and pro-democracy district officials — to hold marches opposing the law on July 1, the politically sensitive anniversary of Hong Kong’s handover to Chinese rule, citing risks from the coronavirus and dangers of violence. If the police decision survives appeal, it would be the first time since 2003 that a march on July 1 has been banned, the Civil Human Rights Front said. Some protesters may ignore the order and march.A survey by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute in mid-June found that 49 percent of respondents “very much oppose” the security legislation, while another 7 percent “somewhat oppose” it, Reuters reported. But the survey also indicated that public backing for street demonstrations had softened: Support for protests fell to 51 percent, down from 58 percent in a poll in March.Western governments object. As China moved forward with plans to impose security laws in Hong Kong, foreign governments criticized the decision. Foreign ministers from the Group of 7 leading industrialized democracies called on China this month to abandon the law, saying that it would undermine the autonomy of the territory.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday that the United States would impose visa restrictions on Chinese officials, including retired ones “believed to be responsible for, or complicit in, undermining Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy.” He did not name any officials or say how many might be barred. Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain has promised to allow nearly three million people from Hong Kong to live and work in the country. Mr. Johnson, however, has left unanswered questions about how those admitted might be able to obtain British citizenship.Taiwan said this month that it would expand efforts to provide refuge to protesters and others who wish to leave Hong Kong. The government said it could, in certain cases, provide work and study visas, as well as assistance securing housing and jobs."
globaltimes_6,2021-04-19,Global Times,China,"Biased tone, misinformation ‘major mistakes’ by BBC on HK riot: Chinese scholar","Victor Gao (center), chair professor of Soochow University and vice president of the Center for China and Globalization, was invited to the BBC's Newsnight to debate Hong Kong secessionist Nathan Law (left) on Saturday. Screenshot from BBC News YouTube channel.There were some major mistakes that the BBC made in its latest TV program Newsnight, including a biased tone and misinformation on the illegal protests led by radical anti-government figures who were wrongfully deemed ""pro-democracy activists,"" a Chinese scholar who recently engaged in an online debate with Hong Kong secessionist Nathan Law told the Global Times. Victor Gao, chair professor of Soochow University and vice president of the Center for China and Globalization, was invited to BBC's Newsnight to debate with Law, after other opposition figures such as Martin Lee Chu-ming and secessionists like Jimmy Lai Chee-ying were sentenced, which the BBC host described as 60- and- 70-something men being thrown into jail for participating in ""peaceful"" protests. When the host emphasized they were ""peaceful protests,"" the BBC got it wrong, Gao noted. ""I understand that foreign media outlets uphold their own values, for example, by claiming that the street protests are a way of exercising democratic rights. But if they still say so after the Capitol Hill riot, it's completely wrong because the nature of rioting in Hong Kong and of storming the Capitol Hill are the same,"" the Chinese scholar said. As translator for former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, Gao is fluent in English. He laid out a number of reasons why the Western media and politicians should stop calling rioters like Law ""pro-democracy activists,"" why the detention of people like Lai and Lee is in line with the local law in Hong Kong, and what is the truth about the anti-government protests in Hong Kong. It was easy to see who gained the upper hand during the debate, as compared with Law - who repeatedly emphasized ""peaceful protests"" - Gao urged both the host and Law to open their eyes and look back at the footage the BBC shot during the citywide rampage and riots in Hong Kong in 2019. ""There was violence everywhere in the streets of Hong Kong, there was a storming of the LegCo building, there was disruption of social order in Hong Kong. If you call that peaceful demonstrations, you are losing your mind, "" Gao said during the BBC show. The Chinese scholar said he also had some messages for absconding Hong Kong secessionists like Law, but he did not have enough time to elaborate on them during the show. ""I want to tell Law that he is now living in the UK, and he should not copy what he did in Hong Kong there, as he will be put into jail if he does the same thing there,"" Gao told the Global Times. While Law appeared to have no other words except ""peaceful protests"" in rebuking Gao's claims during the show, he said in a tweet on Sunday that the Chinese scholar ""was enraged when he realized his smearing attack did not work,"" and he further considered it as ""civility vs barbarity."" However, many netizens saw the embarrassment of Law when Gao called him what he really is - a fugitive who broke the law in Hong Kong. A society ruled by law will hold lawbreakers accountable, which is also the principle applied in the UK, which explained why Gao wants to suggest that Law not engage in the same so-called ""peaceful"" protests in that country, when violent illegal assembly would always face legal consequences. There's another major mistake the BBC made in its program by confusing different ideas, the Chinese scholar further elaborated. For example, broadcasting an interview with Lai, who claimed that under the national security law for Hong Kong, the Chinese government has been causing more ""fear"" and depriving him of his basic rights, which is another false statement, Gao said. ""Lai was recently sentenced for violating the public order ordinance in Hong Kong by taking part in illegal assemblies, which has nothing to do with the national security law for Hong Kong. The BBC got the facts wrong and spread this misinformation to the mainstream public,"" he said. Driven by political motivation amid a deteriorating UK-China relationship, the BBC has become more biased toward China in recent years. Still, the Chinese scholar is willing to take part in such an open debate as it's important to make the public hear the other side of the story when Western understanding about the Hong Kong riots was shaped by radical anti-government rioters. ""Also, I hope the BBC could 'wake up' one day to begin adhering to its journalistic standards [on China-related reporting], instead of serving only as a government tool in containing China,"" he said."

Photo: cnsphotoThe UK, a country with massive untold interests in Hong Kong and wants to retain its colonial influence in the city as much as possible, is now acting tough against China's national security law for its Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). Chinese analysts said on Monday that the actions of the UK are more of a bluff since they can't harm China, but will only damage itself.The measures that the UK would take, including phasing out the use of Chinese firm's technology in its 5G network and offering up to 3 million Hong Kong residents the chance to settle in UK, will cost a huge amount of money and resources for the UK, rather than harm China, experts said.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson declared on Wednesday that China's new national security law in Hong Kong was a ""clear and serious breach"" of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration. It was among the strongest statements he's made as UK prime minister on the matter, Bloomberg reported.Chinese Ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaoming said Monday at a press conference that China's national security legislation for the HKSAR has ensured Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy, and does not affect the capitalist system and judicial independence in Hong Kong.The law on safeguarding national security in HKSAR was enacted to safeguard the 'one country, two systems', Liu noted, adding that the law is fundamental to end chaos and restore order in Hong Kong.Liu responded to the UK's accusation that China broke its promise in the Sino-British Joint Declaration that, ""the copyright of 'one country, two systems' belongs to Chinese former leader Deng Xiaoping, not the Sino-British Joint Declaration,"" and China has never failed to fulfill its international obligations.Cui Hongjian, the director of the Department of European Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Monday that the declaration is just a historical document that reflects the consensus of the two countries on Hong Kong at that time, and the Basic Law and the ""one country, two systems"" are China's domestic affairs rather than a promise to any other country.While the UK believes it has right and responsibility to ""ensure"" Hong Kong's autonomy, with other Western countries having similar opinions, the new national security law proves that their moves and words are useless and meaningless, Cui said.Observers noted that the UK has no power and right to comment or act on Hong Kong, and what it really cares is neither ""democracy"" nor ""human rights,"" but its untold interests in HK autonomy. An expert on international intelligence and security who asked not to be named told the Global Times that ""Hong Kong is an important financial hub and intelligence exchange center, and the UK has tried very hard to retain its inappropriate influence in its former colony, such as keeping engagements with Hong Kong politicians, funding and training proxies to influence the education sectors, as well as building connections with legal professionals.""""The UK, as a crucial member of the Five Eyes Alliance, has used its influence in Hong Kong to collect intelligence about China and influence the city's politics to favor the West after 1997. But given excessive provocation against China led by the US since last year, China has decided not to tolerate their inappropriate influence anymore. So the Johnson administration will definitely feel the pain and will act echoing angry conservative politicians in Britain,"" he said.

The US has at least 20 laws on national security while the UK has at least 3. Why can't China have one to safeguard national security on its own territory? Illustration: GT 'Do me a favor' In response to China's national security law for Hong Kong, London has announced to offer about 350,000 BNO passport holders in Hong Kong, and 2.6 million others eligible, to come to the UK for five years. A year after that, they will be able to apply for citizenship, BBC reported.BNO Passport holders in Hong Kong were granted special status in the 1980s, but have limited rights, and are only entitled to visa-free access to the UK for six months. Under the UK government's new plans, all BNOs and their dependents will be given the right to remain in the UK, including the right to work and study, for five years. At this point, they will be able to apply for settled status, and after a further year, seek citizenship.Cui said this is more like a symbolic announcement, as most young protesters or rioters convicted during the turmoil are not eligible, unless London makes new policies to accept these protesters.On the BNO policy for Hong Kong made by the UK government, Liu said it is a ""gross interference"" in the internal affairs of China and violation of international norms.China will respond to Britain's offer of citizenship to BNO passport holders in Hong Kong once it sees details of the plan, Liu said.""We hope that they will reconsider their position. With regard to China's response, we have to wait and see the specific actions of the UK,"" Liu noted.The anonymous expert noted that if these people leave Hong Kong, they can no longer make trouble in the city for their foreign masters. We won't let the criminals escape, but for ordinary people who love the UK more than China, London can do us a favor and send chartered airplanes to take them away."" ""But these people could become a problem and create economic pressure for the UK, as most of them are neither wealthy nor talented, but a bunch of law breakers, and British people who don't welcome immigrants will be very hostile to them,"" he added.

Photo taken on Nov. 20, 2019 shows Huawei's exhibition booth during a press preview for the 2019 World 5G Convention in Beijing, capital of China.(Xinhua/Li Xin)5G lossChinese tech giant Huawei has become a UK target to vent its ""anger"" at China.The Daily Telegraph reported on Saturday that the UK is expected to begin phasing out the use of Huawei technology in the country's 5G network as soon as this year, after Johnson said last week that he would protect critical British infrastructure from ""hostile state vendors.""  The newspaper said officials are drawing up proposals to stop installing new Huawei equipment in the country's 5G network in six months, and to speed up the removal of technology already in place.However, Chinese analysts said the UK's attitude toward Huawei shows London does not have many options, and the restrictions on Huawei amount to a ""bluff than a bite."" Cui said London's action against Huawei was caused by pressure from the US, but it was reluctant to do because it also benefited from cooperating with Huawei, and China's national security law for Hong Kong provided an excuse for 10 Downing Street to act.If the UK doesn't want Huawei but spends more money for other products with poor quality, ""it's up to you,"" Liu said.If Huawei really has good products, then it should not worry about it, Liu said, adding that the world market is big enough to accommodate Huawei, and Huawei will survive and grow regardless of the discriminatory policies of   countries like the UK and the US.The UK decided in January to let Huawei continue its role in the country's 5G network, but with restrictions. The company was excluded from providing ""core"" 5G gear, despite pressure from the US to crack down on the Chinese firm.Analysts said the British government may ""say one thing but do another,"" as the Johnson administration prioritizes economic interests over political power games.Bluff or bite?Huawei said in a statement it sent to the Global Times on Monday that it ""remains open to discussions with the government,"" and is ""finding ways with customers to manage the proposed US restrictions so the UK can maintain its lead in 5G."" ""All our world-leading products and solutions use technology and components over which the UK government has strict oversight. Our technology is already extensively used in 5G networks across the country, and has helped connect people throughout the lockdown,"" Victor Zhang, Huawei's vice president, said in the statement.The UK is actually aware that it's not a smart move to reverse its policy on Huawei, as the nation can't afford the consequences--from the industrial impact which could cost millions of dollars, to the harm done to China-UK ties, said Ma Jihua, a veteran industry analyst and close follower of Huawei.In late June, just days before the passage of the National Security Law for Hong Kong by Standing Committee of China's NPC - something markets widely anticipated - the UK government approved Huawei's plan to build a one billion pound ($1.24 billion) chip research and manufacturing facility in England.Ma added that China and Europe have long been conducting close cooperation in telecommunications so the two could establish their place in the industry, and the UK and other European countries should think twice before choosing to give up Europe's 5G lead due to US disruption.Cui noted that, fortunately, the UK is not an EU member anymore, so even if it totally excludes Huawei in its national 5G network construction, it won't affect Huawei's cooperation with Europe, which is a much bigger cake than Britain.

globaltimes_8,2020-06-30,Global Times,China," National Security Law to protect HK democracy, freedom: Global Times editorial ","Hong Kong citizens on Tuesday gather to support the National Security Law for Hong Kong. Photo: cnsphotoThe Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) passed the National Security Law for Hong Kong on Tuesday. The law took effect at 11 pm on Tuesday. The full text of the law shows that the law's goal is in line with national security laws across the world. There is nothing in it that suppresses democracy and freedom in Hong Kong. The four categories of crimes the law strikes have nothing to do with freedom of speech, assembly and association. Claims that the law was enacted to strengthen control on Hong Kong society are either prejudiced interpretations or ill-intentioned propaganda. Hong Kong needs a law to safeguard national security. This is the principle established in the Basic Law. Article 23 of the Basic Law stipulates that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ""shall enact laws on its own"" for the sake of national security. But there had been a vacuum in relevant legislation due to opposition forces' obstruction. The city's unrest is directly related to the absence of the national security law. Eventually, it is logical for the central government to take action and for the Standing Committee of the NPC to legislate it. Neither the central government nor Chinese society wants to cancel ""one country, two systems."" However, ""one country, two systems"" does not mean few extreme forces in Hong Kong can collude with the US and other external forces to mess up the city, nor does it allow for violent protests - the so-called beautiful sight - to exist in Hong Kong. The National Security Law safeguards ""one country, two systems"" and will prevent Hong Kong from becoming the most turbulent city in Asia. Inside this barrier, democracy, freedom, pluralism and openness will not be suppressed. Instead, they will be more fully released.""One country, one system"" is an accusation made by Hong Kong's extreme forces and the US and other external forces. The Chinese mainland does not have such intentions. However, there is a malicious scheme to pull Hong Kong from China into the US' power circle and turn the city into a fulcrum for the US to contain China. Some forces in Hong Kong have been actively coordinating with such a scheme.These forces have dragged Hong Kong off the right track of development. Over the past few years, the city has suddenly become highly politicized and violent, caring not about its precious status as an international financial hub. It turned into a puppet of the US and lost its way.It is the National Security Law's core mission to heal these fatal injuries to Hong Kong. In a few hours before it was passed on Tuesday, several Hong Kong secessionist groups announced to disband. The Hang Seng index rose on Tuesday. All these will increase Hong Kong society's confidence in the implementation of the law.Before China passed the National Security Law for Hong Kong, the US announced to revoke its preferential treatment to Hong Kong. But the US only suspended the availability of export license exceptions and ended exports of US defense equipment to Hong Kong. It does not touch Hong Kong's status as a separate customs territory. Thus, the international public opinion generally believes its direct impact will be modest. China is prepared to deal with a worse situation, and the US' threat has failed.No city's vitality and prosperity can be endowed externally. With the help of the National Security Law, Hong Kong needs to step up to stabilize and refocus on economic and social development. Relying on the mainland's super economy, Hong Kong's status as an international financial hub cannot be taken away by anyone. The National Security Law for Hong Kong is not retroactive, and this makes 11 pm, June 30, 2020 a watershed. Those who are aware of the current situation and change their course will be safe. As for those who continue to do evil, the National Security Law for Hong Kong awaits. The law carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment - a tiger with teeth. In particular, the chief perpetrator will face severe punishment.
